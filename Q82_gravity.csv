Gravitational force is basically the same thing as gravity it just has a more scientific name. Next, The gravity is way more different on Earth than it is on the moon because of the distance.

Now here's an example of why distance affects the gravitational force so let's say that there is group 1 and group 2, group 1 has the distance of 3 meters, group 2 has the distance of 10 meters. Group 1 would have more gravitational force because it's closer than group 2. Lastly, The weight changes pending on the location. Since weight is a force that is gravity on objects, an object or thing's weight will increase the more gravity there is and the less gravity there is the object or thing's weight will decrease.Therefore, that's why astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth.

Weight measures the force of gravity that one thing has on the mass of one another. The force of gravity an object has depends on its mass.  The greater the mass the greater its force of gravity. An object weighs more when there is more gravity force on it.  The Earth has more mass than the moon so the Earth has more gravity than the moon. So the astronaut has higher weight on Earth than on the moon and their weight is different ,2,mass is the amount of matter an object has. weight measures the force of gravity that one thing has on the mass of one another. the force of gravity an object has depends on its mass.  the greater the mass the greater its force of gravity. an object weighs more when there is more gravity force on it.  the earth has more mass than the moon so the earth has more gravity than the moon. so the astronaut has higher weight on earth than on the moon and their weight is different

When the astronaut is on earth, they have pounds of meat on their bodies. As we all eat food, it is transported to our digestive system, which gives meat to the body. What also matters is height. We all have height differences, so that also gives us more weight to the body. On earth, gravity is the reason why we sit, can't jump insanely high, and stay on the ground! We have gravity pushing down on us at all times. When an astronaut goes into space towards the moon, they're going to be 10x lighter. It makes sense why. That is because there is no gravity pushing down so that the astronaut's weight inside their body isn't pushing down and not heavy anymore. It lightens the body, and space also has no possible air to breathe in. As the body isn't in breathable air, nor gravity, it makes the astronaut's body float. The moon has no supportive air, it also has no gravity, so the astronaut can jump really high! That is why the astronaut's body is heavier on the moon than on earth.
