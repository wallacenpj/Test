STDT 1,"An astronaut's weight will be different on the moon than on earth because there is more gravity on earth and because of the force, your weight will increase. If you were on the moon, there would be less gravity so that will mean less force, which leads to less weight. "
STDT 4, A person's weight will change because the moon has less gravity than earth  
STDT 6," On Earth, your mass is measured in kilograms and your weight is measured in newtons Mass is the amount of matter in an object and weight is the force experienced by an object due to gravity. Since weight depends on mass and gravity. It only changes when you're  at a different location or place.  Since, there is less gravity on the moon then on earth the weight will be different. "
STDT 8," On the earth you weigh more because there is more gravity, but in space there is not as much gravity so you are not really held down by gravity so you weigh less. "
STDT 10,The moon has less gravity  
STDT 13,His weight is more heaver on earth  but when he on the moon it is mass 
STDT 18, It is diffrent in moon because there is no gravatation so you fly around because you have no gravity. 
STDT 21, on earthwe weigh more than on the moon because gravity their is little gravity on the moon and their is alot on earth 
STDT 23," The moon has less mass than the Earth, therefore our weight decreases if we are on the moon. "
STDT 24," When on Earth your gravitational force is different from when your on the moon. on Earth your gravitational force is greater than when your on the moon, making your weight on Earth more than your weight would be on the moon."
STDT 25," Because the mass of the astronaut is the same on both, but weight is actually a force and it depends on the acceleration due to gravity. On the moon the acceleration due to gravity is 1/6 of the Earth's so the astronaut's weight will be 1/6 lighter on the moon.  "
STDT 27, The weight change because there is no gravity in space . 
STDT 28, the astronaut weight is different on the moon because there is no gravity beacause the smallersize of the moon this mean the astronaut  weight will decrease one the moon and weight depends on mass and gravity. 
STDT 31," The weight on moon is pretty less than how it is on earth.There is a diffrence strength of gravity that's on the moon. The gravity forces that's on the moon is dertermine by the mass.Also,it dertermine by the size of the moon. ... Which will dertermine if you're mass will stay the same."
STDT 32,"The moon has less gravitational force than on earth. So even though the mass is the same, the weight is not. An astronaut would weigh less on the moon. "
STDT 33," The more gravity  it is the more  you will weigh .Also in space  you weight less then you do in Earth, because space has almost no gravity at all."
STDT 40,"The moon's gravity is less than Earth's so an astronauts weights less on the Earth, but his or her mass remains the same."
STDT 44,There both differnt because on earth we measure on killograms bu on the moon it go's down alot and it becomes alot differnt.
STDT 52, He (or she) would weigh less than you would on Earth than on the moon because the moon is smaler and it dose not have that much mass 
STDT 58, Are  weight  on  moon  is less  than  it would be on  Earth  threw to a difference of the strength of gravity on our  moon . The  moon's  gravitation force is determined by the  mass  and the size of the  moon. ;-----------------------; 
STDT 61,Astronaut when they go to the moon they flout then on the earth you walk on your two feet then the the sky period .
STDT 63,Our weight on moon is less than it would be on Earth due to a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon. The moon's gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon. 
STDT 65, beacuse the weight in moon is less that it would be on earth due to a difference of the force of gravity on the moon.  
STDT 69, Because weight is the force of gravity on an object and because there is less gravity on the moon' the astronaut will weigh less then on earth where there is more gravity.
STDT 70,Weight depends on gravity and depending on the gravitational force of your location the less gravity the less weight.On earth the astronaut and suit might weigh 200lbs but in space there is no gravity so you have lower or no weight at all. 
STDT 72,Astronauts weight is different on the moon. The weight on the moon decreases because there is less gravity on the moon and that affects the weight. the weight on the Earth increases because there is more gravity on the Earth.
STDT 74, on the moon the mass will not change because the mass doesnt depend on the gravitation . the weight will change  because of the force .  
STDT 76, The weight would be different since the earth is bigger than the moon. 
STDT 83,"the weight is different on the moon because on earth theres gravity but on the moon there isn't and as it says, Because weight is a measure of force, it requires an object to have both mass and gravity.  "
STDT 84," Astronauts weigh less on the moon because on the moon, there is less mass. Mass is one of the things that affect gravity. Another reason is that the moon is 60% less dense than Earth. Just think of it like this, when you're submerged in water you'll float, like an astronaut in space. I'm saying this because density is another thing that affects the gravitational pull. This is why astronauts weigh less in space. "
STDT 85, liter wait on the moon then the earth
STDT 89," It is different because on earth,the gravity is higher than on the moon."
STDT 95,An Astronaut weights different on the moon than on earth because the moon is smaller than the earth so the Gravity has less force on your body. 
STDT 97,An astronauts weight is different because the location isn't the same and the mass is different and the moons gravity is less. So the astronaut would weigh less.
STDT 99, On earth the gravity is bigger than on the moon in space. Earth works like a big magnet that attracts more objects than in space.  That is why we stay in place on Earth and in space we float.Even if you weigh alot you still float. Because the mass of the earth is so big it attracts more objects. 
STDT 101,"An astronaut's weight would be different on the moon because the moon does not have a very powerful gravitational pull. So whatever the astronaut weighed on Earth, he would weigh less on the moon because even though his mass is the same, there is less gravity pulling down on his mass, so his total weight is less. "
STDT 104," Because weight is the force of gravity on an object, the weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. For example, the moon's gravity is less than Earth's. So an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on Earth, but his or her mass remains the same."
STDT 106," Earth has gravity the moon has less gravity, because the earth has our normal earth weight and the moon let you flout in the air.earth lets us stay on the ground because earth has more gravity because earth has more objects which creates gravity. "
STDT 111," If there is more gravity in one place then the other, the area with the least gravity will make things weigh less. That is why astronaut's weigh less on the moon then on earth."
STDT 115,A astronaut's weight is different because the moon is smaller then the earth. The bigger the plant(or moon) the more gravity so your weight would be less.
STDT 118,The astronaut's weight is reduced on the moon because the Moon is smaller than Earth but the mass doesn't change like the weight. 
STDT 120," An astronauts weight would be different on the moon than it is on the earth because the moon has less gravity than Earth. Since Earth has more gravity, the astronaut's weight would be more than how it would be on the moon. "
STDT 129, I hate FLVS!!!   
STDT 133, the moon has less gravity. 
STDT 139,"An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the gravitational force on the moon is weaker than on Earth. So it doesn't pull you down as much. Weight is the measurement of gravitational pull on an object, so less pull= less weight."
STDT 144, Weight relies on mass and gravity making it lighter on the moon because there is less gravity on the moon 
STDT 157," Weight is the force of gravity on an object,The weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less gravity."
STDT 158,The weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases is outer places
STDT 159,"On Earth, gravity is stronger and weight depends on gravity and mass. Also there's hardly any gravity on the moon. "
STDT 163," The weight of the astronaut changed depending on where he was. He was 175 lbs on Earth, 29 lbs on the moon, and 79 kg without being on a planet and just floating around space. "
STDT 164,Astronaut's weight is different from here on Earth because weight is measured of  force and it requires an object to have both mass and gravity. 
STDT 165,"The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth, because on the Earth were able to stay on the flat ground and walk around which is gravity, so the astronaut's body is balanced on Earth because of the gravity we have. But on the moon or outer space the astronaut's body is floating because there're different types of gas and mass in outer-space. So the astronaut has a rope on the back of his suit, so it can prevent the astronaut's body from floating in space. "
STDT 166,The astronauts weight is always the same. but it seems like less because there is no gravity on the moon. 
STDT 169, The gravity is different out of the earth. so if you put a scale on the ship with the astronaut's and they weid them self there would be less gravity. here we have more so it pulls us down to make us heaver. 
STDT 172, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon has less mass than the earth and the gravitational attraction on the earth is more than the moon  the mass on earth is 100kg and weight is 980n and for the moon the mass is 100kg and weight 162.2n 
STDT 175,when your on the moon your weight is measured by kilograms but when your on earth your weight is measured on pounds
STDT 176, the moon has less gravity so the astronaut's weigh less and if they were on earth they whould stay the same. 
STDT 177, an astroonauts weights is different because 
STDT 185, The reason why an astronaut's weight is different on earth is because there is less gravity on the moon. Weight is a force on an object. That force lessens on the moon basically.  
STDT 186, Our weight on moon is less than it would be on Earth due to a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon. The moon's gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon.for this being said they have less weight in the space (i mean) the moon.
STDT 187,because of the gravity that the earth takes from the moon
STDT 193, because as gravity increases it pulls our bodies more into the ground and causes us to be heavier and on the moon the gravitational pull is less than earth so the moon pulls us weaker than earth does. 
STDT 195,because the moon has less gravity there for their weight is decreased from what it would be on earth
STDT 196,Because when you are on the moon there are less gravity. when you are on land there are more gravity.
STDT 197,The weight on the moon is different because the mass is smaller on the moon then on earth so the gravity is weaker 
STDT 199,The moon has less gravity than earth.
STDT 203,"Since the Moon is smaller than Earth, it has a weaker gravitational pull. In fact, the Moon only has 1/6 the gravity that Earth does. This means you weigh six times less on the Moon than you do on Earth. So an object or person on the moon would weigh 16.5% its weight on earth"
STDT 204,"If I was an Astronaut of course my weight will be different on the moon than it is on Earth for example, the reason why my weight is different because on the moon there's no gravity and on earth we have gravity so on earth I weight more than I will weight on the moon. "
STDT 207, Earth has more  gravitation  polu then the moon 
STDT 208," Because the moon has less gravitional force, making you weigh less. "
STDT 217,The weight on the moon would be less than it would be on earth because of the strength of gravity on the moon. The moon has 0 gravity. 
STDT 222, Because there is no gravity on the moon. If there is no gravity then there is nothing to pull down the mass of their body making them weightless. 
STDT 223,because in space there is no gravity to make an astrounaut fall of hit the ground they will just float.
STDT 224,"Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it's on earth because weight is measured in force.Weight needs gravity because gravity is a force.Earth has more gravity than the moon because the earth is more bigger than the moon.And the bigger the object the more force.So,the weight changes because there's more gravity on earth."
STDT 226,"On earth, we have more gravity so our weight increases. On the moon we would have less gravity, so our weight would decrease."
STDT 229,It decreases because the gravitational pull on earth is stronger then it is on space 
STDT 230, Because when the mass changes the weight chances   
STDT 234, An Astronaut weight is different on the moon because there is no gravity on the moon. The moon would make an Astronaut feel weightless. On the Earth and Astronaut would have gravity to account for his or her weight 
STDT 235, The reason an astronaut weighs differently on the moon is because Earth has a greater gravitational force while the moon relies on the Earth 
STDT 236," Let's start with the basics. Earth has more mass and hence more gravity than the moon. Since weight is affected by mass and gravity and the moon has less mass and therefore less gravity, it would affect weight. It will make you weigh less because the moon has less mass and therefore less  gravity. If the moon was bigger, it would have the opposite effects. Jupiter would have more mass and more gravity, therefore more weight. "
STDT 241," No, because astronauts don't weigh, in space or anything, but they still take up the same space they do on earth, so their weight or mass doesn't change. For example, ""The weight of an object will change if the object is brought farther away from earth"". Did not write this, but it's a main example. As much as you can probably feel weightless in space, you still have the same weight and mass that you are on earth. "
STDT 245, An astronaut's weight is different because the earth and the moon are two different sizes and have different gravity. 
STDT 247," The moon has less gravity than the earth, due to having less mass. Since weight is affected by your mass and the gravity of what you are measuring on, that means that the weight will be lighter than earths "
STDT 248," My mass on a different planet would still be the same as it was on the Earth. Mass refers to the amount of matter in an object, this means that mass will not change even on a different planet.  "
STDT 250, Because there are different gravity strengths. 
STDT 252, An Astronauts weight is different on the moon because the gravitational pull on the moon is not as strong. The astronaut will weigh less on the moon.  
STDT 254,Because the moon has less mass than the earth and more mass = more gravitational force.
STDT 259, Because it has no gravity 
STDT 261," On earth we have gravity, but once you get up in space there's no gravity. If you do not have on gravity boots, once you get into space you will float. The weight is different on earth than it is on the moon.For example, the moon's gravity is less than Earth's. So an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on Earth, but his or her mass remains the same.   "
STDT 264," Gravity and mass determine weight. When the location changes, the weight changes as well. Weight is the force of gravity on an object. In higher-gravity locations, weight is heavier. The location of the earth and the moon is different, which proves  why the weight is different. "
STDT 266, It depends on the location. In outer space your wight get lighter because there is less gravity there.  
STDT 268, The reason an astronaut's weight is different on the moon is because the smaller mass of the moon means that the astronaut will be less drawn to the moon. 
STDT 269," Well, From What I Know,An Astronaut Weighs about 60 pounds On The Moon because the gravity is only 1.62 m/s.On Earth An Astronaut Weighs About 130-160 Pounds Because gravity is 9.807 m/s On Earth.The Difference Is That Earth has Less Mass Then The Moon. "
STDT 271," Let's say on astronuots weight is 150 Ib on Earth, in the moon her weight will be less because the moon has far less gravity than the Earth. "
STDT 272,       An astronauts weight is less on the moon than it is on earth because of it's gravity. The mass will stay the same.
STDT 276, The earth is bigger than the moon so astronaut's weight would be greater on the earth then the moon. 
STDT 280,Because there is less gravity on the moon than there is on earth.
STDT 284,The moon has less gravity or gravitational force than Earth so their weight is less.
STDT 285, it measure a force of both mass and gravity 
STDT 286," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because of gravity. The less gravity there is, the less you weigh. "
STDT 287," Since the moon has less mass than Earth, the Moon has less gravitational pull, which would mean you would weigh less."
STDT 289," On Earth, an astronaut may weigh 175 pounds (778 N). But when the same astronaut is on the moon, the astronaut will weigh 29 pounds (129 N). weight is the force experienced by an object due to gravity. Because weight depends on both mass and gravity. "
STDT 291, Its less gravitational pull on the moon that the earth. 
STDT 294, because gravity 
STDT 297,"His weight is different because there in no gravitational pull, no gravity to hold him down to the ground. So it is like he is a slight as a feather."
STDT 298, the moon's gravity is less than the gravity on Earth. 
STDT 300," All objects with mass have a gravitational pull, the greater the mass, the greater the gravitational pull. Earth's gravitational pull is stronger than every human being, and every object; the weight of a person or thing, depends on the mass of it and the gravitational pull. The moon has less mass than the Earth, meaning it has less gravity/gravitational pull, this causes the pull on humans to not be as strong, ergo the reason that astronaut's weight is lighter.  "
STDT 301," The reason why an astronaut's weight on the moon is different from the weight on the earth is, that the earth has more of a gravitational pull than on the moon. "
STDT 302,Astronauts weigh less because there is less gravity.
STDT 305, On the moon the astronaut's weight would be 29 lbs or pounds.and on earth it would weigh 175 lbs or pounds. Because the weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less.  
STDT 308," The moon has less gravity than the Earth. For example, say your 175lbs on Earth, then you would be 29lbs on the moon.The weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. "
STDT 310, The weight is different because of gravity.  
STDT 315," The gravity on Earth is more than on the moon. If you traveled from Earth to the moon, then your weight would be less thanks to gravity. The moon has less mass and gradational attraction than the Earth, so its gradational force is less. However, our mass stays the same.  "
STDT 323, An astronaut's weight is different because on the moon there is no gravity so there is less weight but on Earth there is gravity so the weight will be regular.  
STDT 325, because when your on the moon there is less gravity  so there is nothing polling you down so you weigh less.
STDT 326, The astronaut's weight was different on the moon then earth because there's no gravity in space. Gravity contributes to the weight of things on earth. 
STDT 328, On the earth there is gravity so therefor thing weigh more. on the moon there is no gravity so there is no weight. 
STDT 334, An astronaut's weight on the moon is much less because the gravitational field strength is much less on the moon than on the earth. 
STDT 343,Because the moon and the earth hav different gravitational pull.
STDT 344," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon is smaller, so the astronaut's weight is different. "
STDT 345," The moon has less gravity than the Earth does, which means in a place with more gravity, weight increases and in a place with less gravity, weight decreases, that's because weight is the force of gravity on an object. "
STDT 347,"  It's because weight is a measure of force. It requires an object to have both mass and gravity. On Earth, your mass is measured in kilograms (kg) and your weight is measured in pounds (lb). "
STDT 349, In space you have no gravity. 
STDT 350,"  It is because there is less gravity, and the moon is smaller which means it has less mass. "
STDT 355, The difference between the weight of astronauts on the earth and the moon is that the moon has a different mass of gravity than the earth does.  
STDT 358,The reason that an astronaut weight is different on the moon is because mass depends on weight and gravity. The gravity on the moon is less than Earths so this means that the astronaut would weigh less.
STDT 362, This assignment was resubmitted and I don't know why and i didn't do anything. The gravity is stronger on earth so your weight would be more on earth than the moon because gravity is not as strong on the moon because its smaller than earth. 
STDT 365, on the moon gravity is less and on earth gravitas is greater and stronger 
STDT 367, Weight depends on both mass and gravity. It changes depending on location. 
STDT 374, an astronauts weight is different because there is less gravity on the moon and it has less mass so that's why astronauts only weigh like 29ibs on the moon 
STDT 377,An astronauts weight is different on the moon than on earth Earth.  This is because the gravitational pull is weaker on the moon. The gravitational pull from the moon to the astronaut is not as strong as that on Earth so the astronauts weight less on the moon. 
STDT 381, An astronaut's weight would be different on the moon than on Earth because on the moon there is no gravity and on Earth there is gravity. 
STDT 384,weight is the force of gravity on an object and there is no gravity on the moon so he would weigh less.  there is gravity on earth so he would weigh more.
STDT 387, Because there is less gravity in outer space. I would weigh less than I already do. 
STDT 391," The earth's mass is greater than the moons giving the earth a greater gravitational force. The weight of a human (or object) relies on the location's gravitational force and the ""thing's""  mass to determine the total lbs or N (newtons).  The gravitational force on an astronaut isn't as strong on the moon than on earth, making an astronauts weight less on the moon than it would on earth. "
STDT 393," Gravity is a force that pulls you down, so if there is less gravity on the moon you will weigh less. "
STDT 399, Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because it has less gravity 
STDT 412, The astronaut weighs less on the moon because it has no gravity. 
STDT 418, The astronaut's weight is going to be  different on the moon than it is on Earth because theres more gravity on earth then on the moon. 
STDT 420," The astronaut's mass does not change, but the size of the celestial being is different and it will modify its weight since it has a different gravitational pull . Since the weight is measured by the mass and the gravitational pull , and the gravitational pull is different on Earth and the moon because of its size , the astronaut's weight will be less on the moon than it will be on Earth. "
STDT 423, The mass of the moon is less than earth. Less mass means less gravitational pull than something with a greater mass. 
STDT 425, The moon has a very weak gravitational put to the center of itself creating less gravity pulling an astronaut down to its surface. 
STDT 428,an astronauts wight is different on the moon because there is less gravity on the moon than on earth which makes the astronauts wight lower.
STDT 429, because weight depends.upon gravity and mass but gravity and mass but gravitynon earth d differs from gravitu on moon 
STDT 434, because theres no gravity so you float because when theres no gravitational force you cannot touch the ground . 
STDT 435,A astronaut's weight on the moon is less because of the lack of gravity.
STDT 437," Weight is the force of gravity on an object, so the weight of the astronaut increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less.  "
STDT 438," It's because the gravity on the moon is less than the gravity on earth, the gravity is less on the moon because the earth is larger in comparison. "
STDT 444," An astronaut's weight would be different on the moon than on Earth because, of the different masses the astronaut would have, and the different gravitational forces."
STDT 446,   His weight would change because there is less gravity on the moon and weight depends on how much gravity and mass an object has. 
STDT 449, Well in space there is a thing called zero gravity and when you are in space you seem to float but on earth there is no zero gravity 
STDT 451, Because the weight on the moon is a measure of force and it needs an object to have mass and gravity. And on the earth our mass is measured in kilograms and in pounds the weight difference is on the earth the astronaut weighed  175 and on the moon he/she weighed 29 lbs. 
STDT 458, an astonaut on a moon weights is less then being on earth the moon has one-sixth of the weight then earth and earth has the 60 then the moon. 
STDT 459," An astronaut's weight would be different on the moon, because the moon's gravitational force decreases than the Earth's gravitational force which increases. The astronaut's weight of 150 pounds on earth will change when he lands on the moon, he will weigh 25 pounds instead. The mass of the astronaut which is 68 kg will stay the same on Earth and the moon. "
STDT 460,An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the mass of the moon is different than the mass of earth so you would weigh different on the moon than earth.
STDT 462, An astonaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because of the gravitational pull. The moon has less gravity so the astronaut's weight is a lot less but his mass is that as on earth. 
STDT 466,"The reason astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth is because, gravity and mass are both factors of weight, and there is less gravity in space/ on the moon, you weigh less. "
STDT 468,Because the force of gravity is less on the Moon than it is on Earth. Weight depends on gravity. 
STDT 476, Because on earth theres stronger force but on the moon there isn't gravity at all. 
STDT 477," If it had less mass than earth, it would be more dense than earth and anyone there would weigh less on the moon. "
STDT 478,On the moon there's less gravity than on Earth. The gravity of Earth is stronger than the one on the moon.
STDT 486, because there is no gravity on the moon 
STDT 487," First, well, the moon is much smaller than the earth and way less dense. So the gravitational attraction on the moon is less than it is on earth. "
STDT 488, The weight on the moon is different than on earths weight because the gravitational force is less on the moon that earth.
STDT 493, It would be that the moon is lighter and because of that your weight would change. 
STDT 499,There is lest gravity on the moon than earth.Earth has a  bigger gravitational force.
STDT 503," The reason the astronaut has a difference in weight is because the gravitational pull on earth is stronger than the gravitational pull on the moon, because the earth is bigger than the moon.  "
STDT 504," Astronaut's weight is different on the Moon than on Earth for two reasons. First, there is less gravity on the moon, and the Moon's distance is farther away from the sun. Weight is the force of gravity on an object, so that means when gravity decreases the amount of weight on an object decreases. For these reasons an astronaut's weight decrease on the moon than on earth. "
STDT 509," The astronauts' mass changes because if you go to the moon it obviously has less gravity than the earth, which affects a man so that he grows taller and gets less weight. "
STDT 515," Earth is far larger that the moon. The bigger the mass the more gravity it has, and since the earth is larger you would way a lot less on the moon. "
STDT 516, a astronauts weight is different on the moon because it is farther from the earth there for there is less gravity 
STDT 518,an astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because of gravity. the moon doesn't have as much gravity as earth and gravity is partly how they measure weight so your weight would be different.
STDT 519, The weight of an object increases if the location has more gravity. The weight of an object decreases if the location has less gravity. 
STDT 522," An astronauts weight would change on the moon then on earth because in space there is not gravity, so therefore with no gravity the mass will change and since the mass changed, it changed the astronauts weight.  "
STDT 526,The astronaut will weight less on the moon because there is no gravity. On earth the astronaut will way more because of the gravity.
STDT 529," Our weight on moon is less than it would be on Earth due to a difference of the power of gravity on the moon. The moon's gravitation force is dependent upon the mass and the size of the moon, which means that if you went to the moon you would definitely weigh less although the mass would stay the say."
STDT 531, The astronauts weight will not change but it might feel like it.  
STDT 533, It is different on the moon because there is zero gravity on the moon then on earth on earth you get pulled down with gravity which ain't the same on the moon. 
STDT 535,"The Moon and the Earth have two very different gravitational pulls. The pull on the moon is lighter than the pull of the Earth, so the weight would change because weight is the amount of gravitational pull on an object and the moon has less gravitational pull. "
STDT 536,the moon has no gravity and since weight is by mass and gravity; it decreases weight.
STDT 537,The astronauts weight is different because there is less gravity on the moon then there is on earth.
STDT 538," The moon has less mass than the earth, so it has less gravitational pull, because the earth has more gravitational pull, you weigh more on earth than the moon. "
STDT 541," There is no gravity in space but there is on the moon, but the gravity on the moon is less than the gravity on earth, but the mass does not change it stays the same. "
STDT 544, Because there is no gravity on the moon while there is gravity on the earth. 
STDT 546, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the gravity pulls less on the moon. 
STDT 547," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because, on earth, the gravity is more than on the moon. Therefore, the astronaut's weight decreases when on the moon.    "
STDT 548, The moon has a very weak atmosphere of sodium and potassium so the moon has a weak gravitational pull.  
STDT 549,"    It has to do with gravity. Weight has to do with the amount of gravitational force that there is on an object. Since there is no gravity on the moon or in space, there is no weight, which is why an astronaut's weight is decreased in space and would be regular on earth. "
STDT 550," If I was astronaut in space, and visited a larger planet than Earth.Then,.I would weigh more because the planet has more mass and gravittaional pull.  "
STDT 552," When an astronaut is standing on the earth, he doesn't jump very high. When he stands on the moon, he jumps higher than he does on Earth. This is because the astronaut weighs less on the moon because he's further from the Earth. "
STDT 555, astrnauts weight is different on the moon because theere is no gravity so theweight goes down . 
STDT 556," Weight, which is the force of gravity of an object, depends on mass and gravity. The moon has less gravity than the earth, so the force of gravity will be less.  Therefore, the weight will be less than it would be on earth.  "
STDT 558," The earth has more mass than the moon, so the astronaut weighs more on the earth than the moon. "
STDT 560,"An astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on the Earth because Earth’s gravitational pull is far stronger than the moon’s. So because the weight of an object is a measure of force, you would weigh less on the moon than you do on Earth."
STDT 562," The astronaut would weigh less on the moon than Earth because of the lack of gravity on the moon. For example, let's say you could jump 1 foot on the Earth. You could maybe  jump 5 feet on the moon because of the lack of gravity pushing down on you, so you weigh less, enabling you to jump higher. "
STDT 565, on earth the weight is normal but when going into space the weight goes down because of the gravity 
STDT 566, Because the earth has a stronger gravitational pull then the moon. 
STDT 567, The amount of gravitational force of two objects depends upon two objects: all mass and distance. 
STDT 574, Because the moon has less mass than the earth meaning that the moon has less gravity than the earth causing the astronaut to become lighter on the moon. 
STDT 575," You will become light because, for example, you're on Saturn and the force would be weaker, so you would weigh lighter than before. "
STDT 589,The weight of an astronaut is different on the moon than earth because the gravitational force is heavier on earth than it is on the moon.
STDT 591,"An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon has less mass, so therefore it has less gravity, and since weight is the measure of gravitational force on an object, there is less gravity affecting the astronaut on the moon than on Earth."
STDT 592, There is no gravity on the moon so the astronaut's weight will be less. Earth has alot of gravity so items fall to the ground. 
STDT 596," On the moon there is not a lot of gravity force on the moon if you jump you will flout up but there is some gravity, so you will go back down but in space astronauts have to have a rope to them because there is no gravity if you don't have a rope you will just flout away but on earth the reason you go back to the ground is that there is more gravity than on the moon. "
STDT 600," An astronaut will weigh less on the moon than on earth because even though he has the same amount of mass in both places, there is less gravity on the moon than on earth, therefore his weight is less. "
STDT 601, An astronaut's weight on the moon is less than it would be on Earth because a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon. Surface gravity of moon is so much less than the surface gravity on earth.
STDT 603,an astronauts weight is different on the moon because  it has less mass
STDT 605,Because the moon doesn’t pull as hard as the Earth.
STDT 608,The astronauts would way less on the moon because the gravtational force is less on the moon than on Earth.
STDT 610," Since weight is the force of gravity on an object, the weight of an object in a location with more gravity  would mean more weight. "
STDT 611, Astronaut weight are different on the moon than the earth because there is not much gravity on the moon so it is like they are nothing (have no mass) but on earth there is gravity that is why we can't fly or float in the air because there is a gravitational pull on earth.  
STDT 616, because in space your mass is like 1/4 or 1/2. 
STDT 617, Astronaut's weight   is different on the moon than it is on Earth because Earth has more gravity than the moon. 
STDT 621, The moon has a less graitational pull 
STDT 624,Because the astronaut is on a place the the gravity is lessened because there is less of a gravitational pull than on earth so if you where on earth and you where 155 pounds instead you are like what 55.
STDT 629, Because in the moon there is less gravity than in earth. 
STDT 634," The moon weighs less than earth, so there is less gravity to pull you  down. "
STDT 636, An astronaut's weight on Earth is different from their weight on the Moon because the Moon has less gravitational force pulling them down. This is also the reason people can jump really high on the Moon.
STDT 648,"On Earth, the gravitational force is stronger than the moon's gravitational force. If an astronaut weighed 100 pounds, he would weigh 16 pounds on the moon because there is less gravitational force pulling him down."
STDT 650, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because weight is the force of gravity on an object. The weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases and a place with less. 
STDT 653,The moon has less gravity then Earth.
STDT 654,the mass on the moon is different then the mass on earth because it is smaller.
STDT 655," The weight is less in a place with less gravity, but in a place with more gravity you gain weight. "
STDT 657,since the moon is smaller than the earth it has a weaker gravitional pull which makes u lighter
STDT 664,The moon has less gravity than the earth meaning that an astronaut on the moon would have a different weight on earth because weight  depends on mass and gravity.
STDT 680," The moon has a smaller mass than the Earth, and the gravitational pull affects weight. "
STDT 682, An astronaut's weight is different because the Earth has more mass than the moon.  
STDT 684,The astronaut's weight is different on the Moon than on Earth because the Moon has a smaller mass than the Earth  making the astronaut's weight lighter on the Moon than on the Earth.
STDT 735,"To begin with, an astronaut's weight is different than it is on the earth than the moon is because of the gravity. First, Gravity is what keeps us down and pulls objects together for example, the Earth and the sun. The reason we have gravity on Earth is that Earth has gravitational force. Gravitational force is basically the same thing as gravity it just has a more scientific name. Next, The gravity is way more different on Earth than it is on the moon because of the distance. Distance affects gravity aswell as weight and mass. A demonstration of why weight and mass effects gravity is let's say there is a group A and a group B, group A has a 10lb ball and a 30lb ball, group B has a 30lb ball and a 30lb ball. Obviously group B would have a greater gravitational force than group A. Now here's an example of why distance affects the gravitational force so let's say that there is group 1 and group 2, group 1 has the distance of 3 meters, group 2 has the distance of 10 meters. Group 1 would have more gravitational force because it's closer than group 2. Lastly, The weight changes pending on the location. Since weight is a force that is gravity on objects, an object or thing's weight will increase the more gravity there is and the less gravity there is the object or thing's weight will decrease.Therefore, that's why astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth. "
STDT 738, An astronaut weighs more on the Earth than the moon because the gravitational pull of the Earth is greater. 
STDT 740, It depends on both mass and gravity. 
STDT 741,Weight is a measure of force and the object needs to have mass and gravity and sense the astronaut is on the moon there is low gravity so his weight would less on the moon.
STDT 742,"Because there is no mass on the moon, however there is mass on Earth,"
STDT 744," The moon has less gravity than Earth, so an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on Earth. "
STDT 757," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon has less mass, resulting in less gravity. "
STDT 761, Well you'd be skinnier or not because mass is the key detail of weight 
STDT 768," It depends on mass and gravity. For example, You would have less weigh in the moon or in space than on Earth. "
STDT 770, because the weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. 
STDT 773,"         An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on the Earth because the astronaut's weight decreases in a location with less gravity, and the moon has less gravity than Earth, so an astronaut's weight will be less on the moon but his mass will stay the same. "
STDT 775," Because Earth has more gravity regularly than space does, and that's why when astronauts are on the moon they weigh differently because of the gravity in space. "
STDT 776," There's less gravity on the moon than on the earth, because the earth is bigger.  "
STDT 777," Because weight depends upon gravity and mass, but gravity on earth d differs from gravity on the moon. "
STDT 781," Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because weight is the force of gravity on an object, the weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less gravity, and the moon is a place with less gravity and the Earth is a place with more gravity."
STDT 783, It is because you are farther away form the earth's gravitational pull so therefor you will way less. 
STDT 784," The more gravity, the heavier the weight. The less gravity, the lighter the weight. The gravity on the moon is weaker than the gravity on earth, therefore making the astronaut have less weight on the moon and more weight on earth. "
STDT 786,Because the moon has no gravity.
STDT 792,because of gravitatinal force it not the same as here on earth then on the moon.
STDT 793,Because the gravity is different on the moon and earth the less gravity the less weight of an object.
STDT 794," An astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the moon has way less gravity than earth so its not keeping the astronauts body down on the the surface that much, so he or she could be floating on the moon. Earth has much more gravity so it keeps the astronauts down which makes them more heavy becuase gravity is pushing them down. "
STDT 796, The reason why an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth is because the gravity on earth is far greater than the gravity on the moon. 
STDT 799, because the moon has very little gravity so you have less weight and earth has more gravity. 
STDT 800," On the moon there is less gravity than on the earth, meaning your weight will be higher when you are on the moon. "
STDT 802," The moons gravity is different from earths gravity so you weigh less on the moon this on earth, but your mass will never change it will remain that same. "
STDT 803, The moon is smaller which means that the moon has a less strong gravitational force but because Earth is larger it has a stronger force giving you more pull therfore you have more weight.
STDT 804,The earth has more gravity then the moon. A person's weight will increase on the Earth where there is more gravity and decrease on the moon because it has less gravity.
STDT 805, The earth's moon has considerably less mass than the earth itself.Not only is the moon smaller then the earth but it is only about 60 percent as dense as earth. Thus the gravitational attraction on the moon is much less than it is here on earth and a person weighs less on the moon. 
STDT 806," Astronauts weight is different on the moon than on Earth because, on the Earth you're weighed in kilograms and because there is no gravity on the moon. You would just be floating in space.  "
STDT 807, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon has less gravity than the Earth. 
STDT 809, There's no gravity in space. 
STDT 811," The earth is larger and has more mass than the moon, so the astronaut's weight is more on the earth than on the moon. "
STDT 812,"because on the moon there is no gravity, so that means that there is no gravational pull"
STDT 815, The moons gravitational force is different on the moon than it is on earth meaning you would weigh different and be alot heavier on earth than you would be on the moon because of its gravitational force. 
STDT 818," Trick Question, Their Weight Doesn't Change, Its Just That There Is Less Gravity On The Moon Then On The Earth. "
STDT 819, 0 gravity (i lazy) 
STDT 821,An astronauts weight is different on the moon then earth because on earth gravity pulls you down and on the moon it's not as much. 
STDT 823," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because Earth has a greater mass than the moon. Meaning that it has a greater gravitational pull, which is why Earth has more weight than the moon.   "
STDT 826, because there is no gravity on the moon so the astronaut will not have the same mass an on earth. 
STDT 828,"depending where you are, like the moon since there is no gravitational force you weight less but on the earth you weight more because there is a lot of gravitational force there."
STDT 830,The weight changes depending on the gravitational force. But the mass never changes.
STDT 831,Earth has a stronger gravitational pull than the moon.  
STDT 837," The moons gravitational force matters on the mass and size of the moon, so since the moon weighs less than the earth. In that case we would weigh less on the moon than we do the earth. "
STDT 839, the gravitational pull is less on the moon than it is on earth 
STDT 846, The gravitational strength on the moon is a lot less than it is on earth. 
STDT 851,because there is no gravity
STDT 854,"its differrent because when ur on the moon u have no gravity and ur body is flowing through the moons atmoshpere,when ur on earth ur not floating so ur body weight doesn`t change."
STDT 857," That's because  they are in space, so their weight has changed differently. "
STDT 860,It is different because there is less gravity on the moon then earth so the astronaut mass will be less then his mass on earth.
STDT 861, The astronaut would weigh a lot more than if hey was on earth because gravity change in space on some planets 
STDT 862, Due to the moon not having gravity an astronaut's weight would be lower than on the Earth. Kinda like when you are in a swimming pool things are less heavy there. 
STDT 863,because theirs not gravity on the moon but there is on earth
STDT 864," Astronauts' weight will become heavier because if, mass is larger, it means you are heavier. "
STDT 867,Earth has a stronger gravitational force than the Moon. So those on the Earth weigh more than those on the Moon.
STDT 874, Because there is more gravity on earth than on the moon. 
STDT 877," Well, the amount of gravity determines how heavy something is. On earth there is much more gravity than on the moon, and so you will weigh more on earth.   "
STDT 878," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because ""weight is a measure of force"", it requires both mass and gravity. Since weight requires  mass and gravity, it changes depending on your location. Weight changes depending on location, because the weight of an object (an astronaut in this case) increases in a location with more gravity, as for a location with less gravity it decreases. And since the moon has less gravity than the earth, the astronaut would weigh less. That is why an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth. "
STDT 879,The reason why is that the moon has lesser mass and then the earth has a weaker gravitational pull. We weight less on the moon and more on earth.
STDT 881, when a scientist goes up in to the moon his or her weight changes into 29 or les weight the weight when they come back to earth is different than the one in space they go back to there normal weight which might be 175 pounds or more. 
STDT 883," Since their is little to no gravitational pull in space at all, the astronauts weight would decrease, making the Astronaut float through space. "
STDT 887,on the moon astronauts don't experience gradational force or pull
STDT 890," Well the reason why an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth is because it depends on gravity and it also depends on the location, because wherever the object is if the location has more gravity than the other that's how high the weight will be plus the weight of the object. Like let's say the object is the astronaut an if it is on Earth, the weight will be more cause Earth has more gravity plus the weight the astronaut weighs, but if the astronaut was on the moon it would be less because the moon has less gravity than Earth but the mass would be the same as Earth. "
STDT 894, The reason why an astronaut has less weight on the moon is because the moon is smaller than the earth and has less gravitational force.  
STDT 904," because weight doesn't just depend on mass, it also depends on gravity, so the less gravity an object has (like the moon), the less you weigh. "
STDT 905, When you are father away from the earth you weigh less because you are further away from the earths gravitational pull. 
STDT 906," The moon’s mass is less than the earth. So, its gravitational attraction (ga) is less than that of earth. And this is why an astronaut weighs differently on the moon than on earth. "
STDT 911, because there is less gravity on the moon than on earth 
STDT 912," Because weight depends upon gravity and mass, but gravity on earth differs from gravity on moon. "
STDT 922," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth  because on the moon  the weight is 29 lbs and on the earth it is  175 lbs .On the moon it is different because in space it, wants to pull you up, but on earth it's different because the earth contains water. "
STDT 929," Since weight is the force of gravity on an object, the weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. "
STDT 933, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than the earth because weight in a measure of force and requires an object to have both gravity and mass. 
STDT 934,"An astronauts weight is different on the moon than on earth because earth has more mass than the moon. The moon does to have as much mass as the earth because the moon is smaller. If the mass on the earth is bigger and the gravity pulls more than  the moon, the and mass is smaller and  the moon has less gravity. That is why we float in space. "
STDT 935, because there is more of a gravitational pull on earth than on the moon and weight increases in a place that has more gravity and decreases in a place with less gravity 
STDT 937," Because the Moon's surface has a gravitational pull that is lower than that of Earth, the astronauts weigh less there. Because of the less gravity that is dragging you down on the Moon, your feet aren't planted. And on the moon you weigh a lot less than on earth. "
STDT 938, the mo n has less gravitational force than earth 
STDT 941, so if you land on the moon your wight whould decrese because of the moon's gravitational pull scene its so weck. 
STDT 949, Because he is further away from earth. 
STDT 953," An  astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because weight depends on the force of gravity on an object and the force of the moon is less than the force on the earth so when the astronaut goes on the moon, the weight will decrees "
STDT 954, The gravitational pull is less on the moon than on earth. 
STDT 955, An astronaut weighs less on the moon because of the gravity not pulling him down as hard. 
STDT 958, There weight is different because the moon is smaller than earth and has less gravitation.  
STDT 960,The force of gravity is different on the moon than it is on Earth.
STDT 963," Because the moon has less mass, therefore the gravitational pull is weaker.On the other hand the earth has a larger mass. This causes a higher gravitational pull. So, if you were to jump on the moon, you would jump higher because of the decrease in weight. If you were to jump on earth your weight would be normal and your jump would be smaller. "
STDT 966," There is gravity on Earth, so it would pull you down more than on the moon would it has no gravity, so you weigh less with no gravity. "
STDT 973," There is less mass on the moon, which lowers the weight. "
STDT 974, The weight is different because the location. The astronaut is  close to the earth increase the weight and if far away decrease the weight.   
STDT 975, This would affect the weight because on earth there is gravity and in space there is no gravity. 
STDT 977, The weight on earth and the moon is different because the moon has less gravity than earth. 
STDT 983, because you are weighed in kilograms on earth and weighed in pounds on the moon and so you are weighed more on earth than the moon. 
STDT 985,The reason why an austronaut's weight is different is because there is no gravity in outer space so the austronaut weighs less. Less Gravity = Less Weight      More Gravity = More Weight.
STDT 993," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because weight is the force of gravity on an object. The weight of an object will increase in a location with more gravity, and decrease in a place with less. As an example, the moon's gravity is less than Earth's. Meaning an astronaut's weight will be less on the moon than it would be on Earth, but their mass will remain the same.  "
STDT 994," An astronaut's weight is lighter on the moon than Earth due to the gravitational pull. The moon has less gravitational pull so their weight would be far lighter, but their weight would be larger on Earth because the gravitational pull is stronger. "
STDT 1001,The astronauts weight is different on the moon and the earth because the moon has less gravity.
STDT 1006, Because the gravity on the moon is less than the gravity on the earth  
STDT 1008, An astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth is because the gravitational pull is decreased more than it is on Earth 
STDT 1012, The reson why is because there is no gravity on the moon. 
STDT 1016,"  The earth is bigger than the moon, so the humans weigh more on earth. Earth is bigger so there is a bigger gravitational force while for the moon it isnt as much. "
STDT 1022,An astronaut weighs less on the moon than on earth because the moon has less gravity than earth.
STDT 1032, The astronaut's weight changed. This happens because when you are in different places with different levels of gravity it will change your weight depending on how much gravity but it would not change your mass. 
STDT 1034,Because the gravity decreases the weight.
STDT 1036, Because of the mass of the moon. 
STDT 1163, I think the astronauts weight is different on the moon because there is less gravity on the moon. 
STDT 1829, Weight is a measure of how much attraction the earth's gravity has to an object. The farther from Earth the less gravity is pulling on them. 
STDT 1831, The gravity on the moon is less than Earths gravity. 
STDT 1832, a astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the moon's gravitational pull is weaker than earth's gravitational pull. That is because the moon is smaller than earth and gravity is determined by a objects mass. 
STDT 1834, there is less gravity on the moon than the Earth dose wick makes him lighter 
STDT 1836," , The moon's gravity is less than Earth's. So an astronaut would weigh less on the moon than on Earth, but the mas of the astronaut  would remain the same on the moon. "
STDT 1837," Our weight on the moon is less than it would be on Earth because of a difference in the strength of gravity on the moon. The moon's gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon. ... This means that if you went to the moon you would weigh less, even though your mass stays the same. "
STDT 1838, He would lose weight because there is less gravity on the moon than on earth. 
STDT 1844, The moon has a low gravity so they can jump high. 
STDT 1845," On the moon you go high, then the earth "
STDT 1851," Let's say on earth you are more than 100 pounds that is because earth has a bigger mass than the moon, whereas when you go on the moon you will be less than 100 pounds because the moon has less mass than the earth. "
STDT 1918, Because the mass on the moon is less than the mass on earth and the moon has less gravity        
STDT 1919, because on the moon the astronaut can float because there gravity in space and on earth the weight is fine it just that it don't have gravity on earth you can walk and jump a little and on the moon you can jump real high because remember there's gravity.
STDT 1921, Because the gravity is different on the moon than it is on earth so they weight less on the moon but their mass is the same. 
STDT 1923, Wait has to do with gravity and the moons is less 
STDT 1929,  The gravity on the moon is less than it is on the earth so the astronauts weight is different 
STDT 1932,  Astronauts weight is different on the moon than on Earth because gravity increases weight and there is more gravity on Earth then on the moon. 
STDT 1934,An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because the gravitational force of the moon is less than earths.
STDT 1935, The gravity force is different on earth then on the moon. 
STDT 1948, Gravity is less on the moon there for making the astronauts less heavy than when they were on earth.
STDT 1949,"An astronaut's weight will be different because the moon has less gravitational pull/force. As I (Bray Keller) wrote down in my guided notes:  ""The law of universal gravitation, or u.g.n, is the concept in which something falls, or stays where it is... down. The u.g.n is less on the moon, so you can jump higher, and objects will float. Sometimes yourself. The u.g.n also creates your weight. I weight about 100 lbs on Earth, but would way far less, less than 30 lbs on the moon."""
STDT 1950," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because on the moon there is less gravity than there is on earth, which makes the astronauts' weight  different because of the different amount of gravity. "
STDT 1951," The astronauts' weight is different on the Moon than on earth because of gravity. Weight requires an object to have mass and gravity. Since on the moon there is less gravity, your weight changes.  "
STDT 1952, you would be much heavier due to the mass of the planit as it has increased gravitational pull 
STDT 1953," An astronauts weight is different on the moon than on earth because their is less gravity on the moon so he is lighter. On earth and on moon the astronauts mass will be the same, but weight is a measurement of matter and gravitational force so the astronauts weight will be different depending on the amount of gravity."
STDT 1958, Earth has more gravity.
STDT 1959, The astronaut's weight would be different because the Moon has less mass and gravity than Earth so you would weigh less. 
STDT 1960," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the Earth has a larger mass than the moon.  Therefore, the astronaut will have more weight on the Earth than on the moon.   "
STDT 1962," The moon has less mass than the earth, so it can not pull things onto it like the earth can, so that means that the astronauts are heavier on the earth than the moon because of gravity.  "
STDT 1967,"Weight is the measure gravity has on an object. Therefore, since the moon has less gravity than Earth, gravity is pulling less on the object than it would on Earth, so the astronaut's weight would decrease."
STDT 1971,the gravity lower on the moon then on earth.
STDT 1972," On earth, a person's weight is more than on the moon because on earth there is more gravity than on the moon. There is more gravity on earth than on the moon because there's more mass on the earth.  "
STDT 1977, The astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the moon is a smaller object and has less gravitational force . 
STDT 1981, When and astronaut is one the moon the weight is difference because they float on regular ground we don't float so all are weight is on us but when there up they float to where it makes the lighter.7 
STDT 1983, The moon has less mass and is smaller than earth so it has a weaker gravitational pull than earth. An astronaut would weigh less on the moon. 
STDT 1984, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon then on the earth because on earth we have more gravity and the moon has less.   
STDT 1986," The moon has significantly less mass than the earth. That is the reason why it has less gravity than the earth, and it will not pull objects toward itself at the strength the earth will. So the astronauts will be lighter on the moon and will be heavier on the earth. "
STDT 1989, On the Moon there is less gravity and on Earth there is more gravity. 
STDT 1990, The astronaut weight is different on the moon then it is on Earth because the gravity is less then on earth.   
STDT 1994," As the astronaut gets farther into space, they start to way less. The mass would stay the same, but the gravity on earth is much stronger than the moon. Therefore, they would weigh more on earth and less on the moon. "
STDT 1995,An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because on earth there's more of a gravitational pull and in space there's less of a gravitational pull.      
STDT 1996, An astronaut weight is different on the moon than on earth because there is more gravity on earth then on the moon.  
STDT 1999, There wegiht was very ligh beacuse there in space not on earth so there wigehit is so like they can slitly float 
STDT 2001," The earth is bigger than the moon, so then the earth has more gravity. If you went on the moon your weight would be less then on the earth. "
STDT 2007, He is lighter on the moon because he does not have the Earth's gravitational pull. Pulling him back down to the moon. He only has a small amount pulling him down. That is the reason he comes back down to the moon.  
STDT 2014, The weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less gravity. 
STDT 2016,"An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on the earth because a person will weigh more wherever the gravity is greatest. the moon has a lot less gravity then the earth,therefore an astronaut will weigh more on earth than on the moon."
STDT 2017,"The reason an astronaut's weight is different on the moon then earth is because, the strength of the gravity on the moon."
STDT 2023, In the moon things way less  because the gravity strength is much less than in earth. 
STDT 2026,weight on moon is less than it would be on Earth due to a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon.
STDT 2027,"       In space, the gravity is zero gravity or zero G. This rule stays the same for when on the moon as well.      On earth, the mass is different.      These gravity differences will change the weight of people in space. "
STDT 2030,"If we change location from earth to the moon. The astronaut's weight on earth will have gravity (the force of attraction between the astronaut and earth), while on the moon there is no gravity, he will weight less."
STDT 2031, The gravitational field strength is less then on earth.  
STDT 2032, the reason why they are different weights is because there is no gravity that exist in space                            
STDT 2033, When a astronaut go's to the moon his weight changes because the moon has no gravity. 
STDT 2034, The reason why you weigh less on the moon is because the gravitational pull is not as strong as it is on earth. 
STDT 2036," The astronaut's weight changed, but their mass didn't. Your weight on the Moon is less than on Earth. Mass never changes. For example, an astronaut that would weigh 175 pounds on Earth only weighs 29 pounds. "
STDT 2040, An astronaut's weight is lighter on the moon because the moon has less gravity than the Earth. 
STDT 2052, The reason we weigh different on the moon is because there is no gravity on the moon so if you weigh a hundred pounds on earth you would probably only weigh 50 on the moon. 
STDT 2055, an astronaut's weight on the moon is different than the weight on earth because weight is the force of an object due to its mass and gravity. On the moon the gravitational pull is different than it is on earth and therefore results in different weight. 
STDT 2059, Because the weight could be different on earth than it is on the moon because there can be more gravity on the moon than on earth.  
STDT 2062, On the moon you do not become lighter your mass is constant throughout the universe you may feel the perception that you are lighter because the force of attraction of gravity is much smaller then the force of gravity on earth 
STDT 2063, An astronauts weight  is different  on the moon because on earth it has more mass than moon has. The bigger the plant is the more mass it has and the smaller the planet the less mass it has. So for example Mars would have less so it would be like a trampoline.and for in another example is the bigger the plant is you can walk but on earth if you jump than you will go back down. And if you jump on the moon then you will stay up there for a little bit and then you will go back down. And gravity changes you weight the more gravity the more you weigh the more mass you have.  
STDT 2064," On earth, the gravitational pull is greater than the moon's gravitational pull, meaning that if we jump on earth we will move back towards it, and go down, but on the moon, it's so much weaker that when you jump, you jump much higher, and still get pulled down, meaning that on earth our weight is much greater than our weight on the moon. "
STDT 2067,there is less gravity pulling them down.
STDT 2070, The weight of an astronaut is low on the moon because it doesn't have as much as on Earth. 
STDT 2072," The reason the astronauts weight is different on the moon than hear is because their is more gravity on Earth. For example, the mass on Earth is greater so their is more gravity. "
STDT 2073, It would increase because gravity is based on whether the mass is a large amount or a small amount and there would be more gravity that means more weight so it will be harder to jump walk because of how there is more weight. 
STDT 2078," An astronauts weight is different on the ammo than it is on earth because, the moon is smaller tan earth. "
STDT 2079," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon because there is less gravity, so he would weigh less. The astronaut's weight on earth would be more because there is more gravity of earth. "
STDT 2080,"The gravity on the moon is less than it is on Earth and gravity affects an object's weight. Therefore, An astronaut will have less weight on the moon than on Earth."
STDT 2081,An astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because weight is both the mass and gravity. So your weight would be greater in a place with more gravity but if you were in a place with less gravity your weight would be less. 
STDT 2082, On earth the gravity is stronger than on the moon. Thats why we can walk on earth and stuff stay on earth and on the moon everything floats around because there is no gravity on the moon 
STDT 2083," An astronaut's weight is different, because on the earth the mass will stay the same and the weight will be higher because the gravity on the earth is high. When the astronaut is on the moon, the mass will stay the same and the weight will be lower because the gravity on the moon is low. "
STDT 2084,"When an astronaut is on the moon or in space he is in an atmosphere with little or no gravity therefore gravity is not pushing down on him. This however, does not affect his mass, therefore, he stays the same size. In conclusion, weight is created by an object with mass and a source of gravity."
STDT 2089, on the moon it's a lot smaller then earth. and the gravity is weaker. 
STDT 2090,The weight is different  because gravity is different on the moon then earth. 
STDT 2092, Yes my weight would change. My weight in a place with more gravity would increase  and in a place with less it would decreases. 
STDT 2104,The moon has a lot less gravity than Earth which has more gravitational pull in its atmosphere.
STDT 2107," An astronaut's weight is less on the moon than on earth because, the moon has less mass than earth does. "
STDT 2110," The weight of the astronaut is different on the moon than it is on the earth, because the astronaut's weight decreases in a place with less gravity."
STDT 2115, On the moon there is less gravity so that means that the astronaut weighs less because the gravity is less than on earth.   
STDT 2119, i think that the astronaut would weigh more on this other planet than on earth 
STDT 2122, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because in earth the pull of gravity is stronger than the pull of gravity of the moon and that is why the  earth has a greater pull of gravity than the moons pull of gravity. 
STDT 2123, Objects on the moon weigh less than they do on earth because gravitational field is a lot less. for example astronauts can jump higher on the moon.   
STDT 2124, The reason the astronaut weight is different on the moon than it is on earth is because there is no gravity in space. 
STDT 2125, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because there is no gravity on the moon. That is because weight is the force of gravity on someone. 
STDT 2128,The moon has zero gravity different to earth and makes the astronauts weight different.
STDT 2131,  There is no gravity in space. 
STDT 2132,"Because of the gravitational strength on the moon vs on earth. The earth's gravity is way bigger than the moon's gravity. And by process of elimination, you weight almost nothing in space!"
STDT 2133, Objects on the moon weigh less than on earth. That's because the gravitational strength is much less. on the moon you can jump higher and leap farther than on earth. the greater the mass of something the greater the weight.  
STDT 2136,The gravitational attraction on the moon is much less than it is here on earth and a person weighs less on the moon
STDT 2137," On Earth, whenever you jump you come down within a few mili seconds.   For example  If you drop a ball on Earth it will fall straight down.   On the Moon, when you drop it will take an estimate of 5 - 10 seconds.   For example if you were to drop a ball on the moon it would take forever. (good luck getting that ball back) "
STDT 2140, On the moon there is less gravity than on the earth so people weigh less when they are on the moon. There is less gravity on the moon beacause it has less mass than the earth.
STDT 2142,  an astronaut's weight is different on earth than it is on the moon because there's LITTLE gravity on the MOON than there is on the erath. 
STDT 2144,the moons gravity is less than than the earths gravity 
STDT 2146, the force on the earth is much stronger than the force on the moon. There is more mass on the earth than on the moon.
STDT 2148," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because on Earth there is more gravity to keep us on the ground. On the moon there is less gravity. Weight is the force of an object's mass and gravity. So, if there is less gravity on the moon, the astronaut will weigh less. "
STDT 2151, because their is way less gravity on the moon  
STDT 2152,the gravitational pull is less on the moon than the earth because the moon is smaller
STDT 2153," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon has less mass and gravity than Earth.  Therefore, the astronaut's weight will be less on the moon than it would on Earth. "
STDT 2163, An astronaut's weight would be different on the moon than it would on Earth because of gravity. The moon has less gravitational pull so the astronaut would weigh less on the moon then he would on Earth. He would take up the same sapce but have a different weight. The Earth has more gravity making the astonaut weigh more on Earth.  
STDT 2164," Since the gravitational force is less on the moon, the astronaut's weight decreases. Since the force on Earth is more than on the Moon, the weight increases. "
STDT 2169, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because it has less gravity than the earth. 
STDT 2171,on earth weight is heavier so they are pulled to earth more. on the moon their weight is less than on earth so astronauts float more because there's not as much gravity because they weight less.
STDT 2173,because the moon has less mass than the earth so you will be lighter on the moon
STDT 2175, Because the Moon has a less gravity isn`t as strong as Earth`s gravity.
STDT 2185," There is much less gravity on the moon and on the moon there is less mass , weighing you down with pressure, there are also no air molecules in space so that helps you float, which decreases your weight and force to lift you. "
STDT 2188," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because we have weight due to gravity, and on the moon there is a little bit of gravity but not much.  "
STDT 2197, The weight is different because the gravity. 
STDT 2205,Because there is less gravitational pull in outer space and on the moon. there is more gravitational  pull on earth.  
STDT 2208," An astronauts weight is less on the moon because the moon and space in general have less gravity than earth. For example,an astronauts weight can be 150 pounds on earth and on the moon their weight can be less than 25 pounds."
STDT 2211, I'll describe it in a couple of words: There. Is. No. Gravity. (And I think the force of space is pushing from below you and above you? Take that with a grain of salt.) 
STDT 2212,"The moon is much smaller, making the astronaut weigh less."
STDT 2215,the less amount of gravity causes astronauts weight to be lighter on the moon than on earth.  
STDT 2216,The gravitational attraction on the moon is much less than it is on earth and a persons weight is less on the moon.
STDT 2217, Astronauts weigh less on the moon because the moon has less gravitational pull. The moon has less gravitational pull because of the atmosphere. 
STDT 2221,The astronaut's weight did change while their mass did not. Their weight changed because the moon's mass is smaller therefore the gravitational  pull was lessened which caused the astronaut's weight to change. Their mass  did not change because mass is the amount of matter in an object (Human in this case) and doesn't change when going into orbit to visit the moon. The astronaut's weight did change while their mass did not. Their weight changed because the moon's mass is smaller therefore the gravitational  pull was lessened which caused the astronaut's weight to change. Their mass  did not change because mass is the amount of matter in an object (Human in this case) and doesn't change when going into orbit to visit the moon. 
STDT 2225, In space there is a weaker gravitational force then on the earth. On earth there is more gravity than on the moon. 
STDT 2227, The moon has less gravity than Earth. Earth has lots of mass  and further you go in space the less gravity you have and weight. 
STDT 2236, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the gravitational pull is stronger on  Earth. 
STDT 2237, The gravitational attraction on the Moon is less than it is on Earth. 
STDT 2238," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon's gravity is less than the Earth's. Since the mass of the Earth is huge, it makes a strong gravitational force. The moon's mass is nowhere near the mass of the Earth, so its gravitational force is nowhere near as strong. "
STDT 2239,"An Astronaut’s weight will be less on the moon because there is no gravity on the moon.  However, on the earth the weight will be more because of gravity on the earth."
STDT 2245, Astronaut's weight is different because the moon has less mass than the earth so there is less gravity. 
STDT 2246," Because the earth's gravity will have a lot more force pulling us down to earth, because it has more mass than the moon, so the astronaut will weigh more on earth then on the moon.  But the moon will have less gravity than the earth, then the astronaut will weigh less. "
STDT 2247,"             An astronaut's weight would be different on the moon than on Earth because they are farther apart. The moon does not have a strong gravitational pull, and the astronaut would weigh less. "
STDT 2252," Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth , because of gravity.     "
STDT 2253, It is less because it doesn't have as much mass or as big of a gravitational pull as the earth. 
STDT 1742,There's gravity on earth but not the moon because of earth having north pole and south pole keeping earth from balance and gravity.
STDT 2257," When the astronaut  landed on the moon there was no gravity, so they end up kind of  like flying, but they can control it. yes the astronauts got lighter mass.weight is the force with which an object is pulled toward the center of the earth or any other body.  and this force is called gravitational force. "
STDT 2259," Astronaut's weight is different on the moon because of their gravity that control the human body. See on earth you are on the ground but then when in space you float which that effect is called gravity.Gravity can control the motion of the human body it can pull and push you,on the earth gravity pulls you to the ground when in space gravity pushes you. Then don't forget there isn't really any logical stuff behind it science really because of the lack of truth and false. "
STDT 2263,"  Since earth is bigger and has more mass its gravity is greater, so it pulls them down which is why we weigh more and why we don't go floating around.On the moon its different since its smaller it has gravitational force that isn't that strong so they weigh less on the moon.   In conclusion,this is why weight is different on earth and on the moon."
STDT 2265, The weight on a moon is less than the weight on earth due to gravity. 
STDT 2266, Because the moon is smaller it has less of a gravitational pull.
STDT 2267, This would affect your weight because the more mass of the planet equals more gravitational force pull which causes you to weigh more. 
STDT 2268, It is different because the gravitational pull on the  moon is different from how it is on earth. 
STDT 2278, The amount of gravity on the moon is less. An astronaut weighs less in space.An astronaut  weighs more on earth because there is more gravity.    
STDT 2281, Because or gravity  
STDT 2284, The astronauts' weight is different on the moon then on earth is because gravity is less on the moon then on earth. 
STDT 2288,There's force on earth It's because weight is a measure of force. It has to have both mass and gravity. There is no gravity in space so you weight more on earth than you would in space.
STDT 2291, Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the earth because the moon has less gravity than the earth does. 
STDT 2292, You become lighter because there’s more surface of gravity on earth  the moon has 1.62 and earth has 9.81
STDT 2294," On earth, our weight is heavier than it would be in space because there isn't much of a gravitational pull to hold us down, so an astronaut's weight would be very different than here on earth. (:   "
STDT 2299, because the moon doesn't pull as hard as earth 
STDT 2303, Am astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the mass of the moon is smaller so the pull of gravity is less. 
STDT 2317," An astronaut's weight would be different on the moon than on Earth, because of the force of gravity on the moon. On the Moon, the force of gravity is different than on Earth. On the Moon, astronauts would weigh less because the gravitational pull is less than on Earth. The more gravitational pull a planet has, the more a person will weigh. "
STDT 2319,because earth is bigger than the moon and it has more gravitational pull
STDT 2323, The strength of the gravity on the moon is weaker than Earths gravity.  
STDT 2328," The astronauts weight is going to be different because the earth and moon have two different types of gravity, so human weight will decrease if there is less gravity. "
STDT 2329, The other planet may not have enough gravitational pull as the larger one or enough oxygen. It would be safe to say that wearing a suit would be best.
STDT 2331, The moon has a different gravitational poll then earth. 
STDT 2332,"   Our weight  on  moon  is less  than  it would be on  Earth, because of the  strength  of  gravity on the  moon. So you would be able to walk but it wouldn't be like your walking on earth. "
STDT 2334, The moon has less gravity so his weight will change but his mass will stay the same cause mass never changes no matter how far out in space you are. 
STDT 2336," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on the Earth because on the moon there is less gravity holding you down, so you are lighter.  "
STDT 2338, the moon has less gravity then earth  
STDT 2342,"an astronaut's weight on the moon decreases because of gravity, and when there on earth the opposite thing happens"
STDT 2344," It is different because the closer you are to the moon the more gravity, and the moon is farther away than the earth, so the gravity will be different, and since there's less gravity, they use a different weighing system, making you appear lighter on the moon than on earth. "
STDT 2351, The weight of the astronaut on earth is greater than his weight on the moon. 
STDT 2352, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because theres barely any gravity on the moon but on earth theres plenty of gravity.  
STDT 2353, The astronauts weight is different on the moon because the gravity is less on the moon than earth. 
STDT 2354,"on earth you have more force which means you way more, but when your on the moon there is less force on you so weigh less.  "
STDT 2355," Well the moon has a lot less gravity than Earth, and weight increases where there is more gravity, and weight decreases when there is less gravity. And, like I have stated before, the moon has less gravity, making you weight at least six time lighter than you are. Don't believe me? Well here is some math to prove it, or to just generally show what I am trying to prove.  Say you are 152 pounds. Divide that by six and you get, 25.3333333333, which if you round that up would be about 25 pounds. What if you are 123 pounds? Well if you divide that by six you would 20.5, which obviously means you are twenty and a half pounds.vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv "
STDT 2356, The moon has less gravity than earth. The mass will stay the same but weight will stay the same.  
STDT 2361, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because the gravitational force on the moon is weaker than on Earth.  The gravitational force on the moon is weaker than on Earth because the farther away two objects are from each other the weaker the gravitational force. 
STDT 2364," On earth there is a gravitational pull unlike the moon where there's a weak gravitational pull, so you would weight different. "
STDT 2366, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon is smaller than earth is. 
STDT 2367,It's because the amount of gravity pulling the astronaut to the moon on the moon is less than the amount of gravity pulling him to the earth on earth.
STDT 2368,There is less gravity on the moon then there is on the earth. So then he will be lighter on the moon then earth.
STDT 2370," Well an astronaut weighs is different on the moon than its on earth because, in the moon there is less gravity than the Earth so its understandable it will be different weight!. "
STDT 2374,Because the mass in a humans body changes on the earth because the gravity the moon has
STDT 2377, Because the  moon's  gravational pull is less then the earth's gravational  pull .
STDT 2381, An astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because weight increases in a location with more gravity and decreases with less gravity. 
STDT 2387, An astronauts weight is different on the moon because the moon has a smaller mass than Earth. 
STDT 2393, Astronaut weight is different on earth than the moon because on earth the gravity is pulling everyone to the ground and on the moon there is blearily any gravity that is why your weight is less on the moon and your weight is more on earth. 
STDT 2395,"An astronaut's weight would be different on the moon than on earth because, weight is the force of gravity on an object and there is less gravity on the moon than the earth, therefore an astronaut would weigh less on a planet with less gravity than earth."
STDT 2399,"Weight is the product of gravity acting on the mass of an object. Therefore, the same object can weight differently on different planets in the universe as long as gravity varies. The gravity of the moon is 1/3 that of earth so definitely astronauts will weigh less on the moon than on earth."
STDT 2401," The moon is smaller than earth, so it's gravitational pull is weaker than it is on earth. "
STDT 2402," An astronaut's weight would be different because there is less gravity. His mass would stay the same though, because the astronaut didn't get any bigger or any smaller. "
STDT 2403," Because the moon is smaller than the earth, meaning that the moon has less mass than the earth, so the moon has less gravity, so the astronaut weighs less. "
STDT 2404," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because of gravity. On the moon you have less gravity, so gravity will pull you down a little bit but you will need to be very heavy or need to wear something heavy.  "
STDT 2410," I think astronauts' weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because of gravity. In space there is no gravity, but on earth there is plenty of gravity. When you jump in space, you stay in the air because there is no gravity in space.If you jump on earth, gravity will pull you back down to the ground. Weight is the force of gravity on an object. The weight will increase in a place with more gravity, but in a place with no gravity, your weight will decrease. "
STDT 2413," The astronaut weighs more on earth because there is more gravity, but on the moon there is less gravity, so the astronaut weighs less. "
STDT 2414,An astronaut's weight would be different on the moon than on Earth because the gravity on the moon is not as strong as it is on the Earth. The moon is smaller than the Earth.
STDT 2421," When Armstrong and his crew landed on the moon their weight was changed, but their mass stays the same because weight is effected by gravity. say one of the crew members was 170 pounds, on the moon he or she would only weigh about 20 pounds. "
STDT 2424, The moon is smaller than the earth so it has a weaker mass than we have here on earth. The earth has more gravitational pull so that means you would weigh less on the moon. 
STDT 2426, An Astronauts weight is different on the moon than the Earth because the moon is smaller than the Earth. Since the moons mass is smaller there is less gravitational force causing the astronaut to weigh less than on Earth which has more gravitational force. 
STDT 2430," The more gravity there is, the more you weigh. The less gravity there is, the less you weigh.  On the moon, you are going to weigh less because there is less gravity on the earth. You are going to weigh more because there is more gravity. "
STDT 2431," An astronaut's weight is different on the Moon than it is on the Earth because of the gravitational pull. The astronaut's mass does not change, and the amount of matter he is made up of does not change. What changes is the force of gravity pushing him down. This would be dependent on where he is at. In space, on the Moon, or on another planet. The astronaut will weigh less on the moon than on earth, because Earth is larger than the Moon, has more mass and therefore has more of a gravitational pull. "
STDT 2432," Because the moon has less mass, in turn exerting less gravitational force (the astronaut is lighter.).  "
STDT 2433," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because, weight is a measure of mass and gravity. On the moon, there is less of a gravitational pull than on earth. Therefore, causing the astronaut to weigh less. "
STDT 2436," On the moon there is less gravity, so you weigh much less. Gravity causes weight to be much greater. Your mass stays the same.  "
STDT 1443, The reason for this is because the gravitational attraction is much less compared to earth. This was discovered by a man named Sir Isaac Newton who did research and discovered this. 
STDT 2441," The moon has less mass. Therefore, the gravitational force is weaker.  "
STDT 2442,there is a difference in the strength of gravity on the mon
STDT 2444, Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because there is less gravitational force on the moon.O 
STDT 2445, An astronaut would be lighter on the moon because there is a lot less gravity.   
STDT 2446, Our weight is decreased when we get to the moon because the gravity on the moon is less than the gravity on earth.  
STDT 2447, Because of less gravity the weight decreases but the mass stays the same so it would feel as if you were carrying less.
STDT 2449, The weight is different because the bigger the mass the stronger the gravitational pull and moon is smaller than the earth therefore the gravitational pull is stronger on the earth than the moon.   
STDT 2453,The persons weight would decrease because the gravitational pull is less on the moon than it is on earth.
STDT 2455,"On Earth, the gravitational force pulls you down with cause you to have weight.in space thers no gravity pulling you down so you have no weight "
STDT 2457," I think that it's different because when you're on the moon there is no gravity, and when there is no gravity you get lighter in weight. "
STDT 2459, The astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon's gravity is less than the earth. 
STDT 2461,An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because weight is the amount of force on an object.So a place with less gravity will have less of a pull on the object and the object will have less weight.
STDT 2462, An astronuats weight is diffrerent on the moon then earth because on earth gravity pulls you down and on the moon its not as much.  
STDT 2465," In my own words, astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because. the moon has no gravity but the earth has gravity so a human wood way more than on earth but the moon a human wood weight less than then on earth."
STDT 2467,"since weight changes on location, the astronaut's weight would change because the moon has less gravitational force so their weight would also decrease. "
STDT 2468," On Earth our mass is 79 kg and on the mass it's also 79 kg, the Earth as a gravitational pull on us but on the moon astronauts can jump high, it's because his gravitational pull is less than on Earth, but it's mass always stays the same no matter if you're in Jupiter or on Neptune your mass always stays the same, it's like the sun, the Planet orbiting around the sun because it has a massive gravitational pull and that is the reason that Jupiter has 80 moons.  "
STDT 2471,An astronaut is further away from the earth where gravity is strong so he weighs less on the moon then on earth due to the gravity and its pull.
STDT 2472," The moon has less gravity than on earth. So, therefore, the astronauts' weight will feel like it weighs less than it is on earth. Though the mass of the astronaut will stay the same. "
STDT 2473, An astronaut would weigh less on the moon than he would on Earth because on Earth there is more gravity than there is on the moon. 
STDT 2477, Gravity is different on the moon as opposed to Earth because they are different masses.  So the weight is more on Earth because Earth has a bigger mass.   
STDT 2478, Because there is  less gravity  on the  moon than  on the earth. 
STDT 2479, An astronauts weight is different on the Moon than on Earth because there is less of a gravitational pull which makes the astronauts lighter and it's also how moon jumping is caused when astronauts are on the moon while jumping high in space. 
STDT 2481," People's weight will change because the earth has more gravity then the moon. And the moon has less, so the weight on the earth will decrease and on the moon it will increase. "
STDT 2484, Because there is more gravity on earth an astronaut would weigh more than they would on the moon where there is less gravity. 
STDT 2486, i think on the moon you weigh less so its easier to get around 
STDT 2493," An astronaut's weight on the moon is different from how much they weigh here on earth because the moon has less gravity. Therefore, they will they will lose weight on the moon. "
STDT 2494, An astronaut's weight is less on the moon because there is less gravity than on Earth and weight is the force experienced by an object due to gravity. 
STDT 2496, because there are diffrent locations that have more gravity then other places 
STDT 2498, Earth haves more gravity and is bigger so you will  weigh more and the moon is smaller in haves less gravity so you will weigh less.
STDT 2501, There is less gravity on the moon than on earth. 
STDT 2502, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon because there is less gravity pulling down 
STDT 2503," The reason why an astronaut's weight is different on the moon then on earth is because the mass of each planet in the solar system affects your weight for example if you went to Jupiter, you would weigh much more on Jupiter than you would on earth so if you went on the moon, you'd weigh much less than you did on earth because Jupiter has more mass than earth and the moon has less.  "
STDT 2505, An astronaut's weight is different because there is no gravity y the moon. And no gravity no weight. 
STDT 2506," earth's mass is greater than the moon's, so the gravitational pull will be stronger on earth. the greater the mass, the stronger the pull."
STDT 2507,The astronauts weight is different on the moon because there is less gravity so it effects the mass of the person and the mass is apart of the weight so the weight decreases.
STDT 2508, There is more gravity on Earth than on the moon. 
STDT 2511," Weight is the force of gravity on an object. An astronaut's weight on the moon would be less than it would be on Earth because of the differences of gravity. The weight of an object increases in places with more gravity, so because Earth has more gravity than the moon, an astronaut weighs more on Earth than on the moon. The mass would stay the same, though. "
STDT 2513, Our weight on the moon is less than it would be on earth due to a difference of strength of gravity on the moon.      
STDT 2515,the astronauts weight is different on the moon than on earth because there is less gravitational pull.
STDT 2516," The gravity is lower on the moon, which means the astronaut weighs less. NM  "
STDT 2518,Because the moon has less gravitational pull than Earth.
STDT 2519,Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon's gravity is less than Earth's gravity.
STDT 2521,"An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because there is less gravity on the moon then on earth.  The more gravity you have, they more something weighs."
STDT 2522," Why an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it originally was on earth is because the gravitational field on the moon is way less than Earth's. In other words, it's gravitational strength isn't as strong as ours, making it rather loosely compared to Earth. Which is also a reason astronauts can jump way higher on the moon than Earth. "
STDT 2523, A person's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because has less gravity than the Earth. 
STDT 2524," Someone's weight will increase in a place that has more gravity. In a place with less gravity, their weight will lower.  "
STDT 2527, Weight is the force experienced by objects due to gravity. 
STDT 2528, an astronauts weigh is different than the moon because the moon has no gravity earth does so astronauts are lighter on the moon than on earth
STDT 2531, An astronaut weighs less on the moon because there is less gravity on the moon.This is because the moon is smaller than the earth so the gravitational pull is less.
STDT 2538, Astronauts would weigh less on the moon because the moon does not have as much mass as the Earth.
STDT 2541, the astrounots weight is not as much because the moon has a smaller gravitaniol pull 
STDT 2544," The gravitational force on Earth is greater than that of the Moon, as it is larger than the Moon. This causes your weight to differ between when you're on Earth versus the Moon. "
STDT 2548,"Because the Moon has less gravity than our Earth, so an astronaut weighs less on the moon."
STDT 2550,litter
STDT 2555," There's a difference in the astronaut's weight on the moon than to earth because there is less gravity on the moon than on the earth, so the astronaut is lighter and on the earth there is more gravitational force, so he is really heavy.   "
STDT 2556," The force of gravity is much less on the moon, and weight is force experienced due to gravity.  So when gravity changes, weight changes. "
STDT 2559," The earth has a stronger gravitational pull than the moon does, so less gravitational pressure on you. That's why, on earth, you would weigh 130 pounds. On the moon, you'd weigh 20 pounds.  "
STDT 2562, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon has less gravity than the earth . 
STDT 2826,Mass is the amount of matter an object has. Weight measures the force of gravity that one thing has on the mass of one another. The force of gravity an object has depends on its mass.  The greater the mass the greater its force of gravity. An object weighs more when there is more gravity force on it.  The Earth has more mass than the moon so the Earth has more gravity than the moon. So the astronaut has higher weight on Earth than on the moon and their weight is different 
STDT 2832,There is a lot less gravity on the moon then on earth. so we have less weight on the moon because there is not as much gravity pulling us down.
STDT 2836, The weight is different because of the force of gravity. 
STDT 2840, we are lighter because there's less mass
STDT 2843, The weight of an astronaut is less on the Moon than on Earth because the Moon has less gravity than Earth so it has less gravitational pull. 
STDT 2845, The moon has a smaller amount of mass than the earth because the moon is smaller than the earth. An astronaut's weight will be less on the moon because having less mass means having less gravitational pull.
STDT 2851," The mass of the moon is lower then the mass of the earth, so the weight of the astronaut is less severe because the gravitational force is lower. "
STDT 2852, An Astronaut weight's different on the moon than the Earth because on the moon there is less gravitation than on the Earth. The gravitational pull is more on the Earth than on the moon and that is why you have less weight on the moon. 
STDT 2857, We would be lighter because the gravity would be less than earth  
STDT 2859," An astronaut's weight is different on the Earth compared to the moon because the moon has less gravitational pull,thus making the astronaut weigh less on the moon."
STDT 2860, On earth the gravity pushes me down making me weigh more however on the moon there is not as much gravity so i would not 
STDT 2862, The difference in an astronaut's weight on the moon is because there is hardly any gravity in space.   
STDT 2865,Because on the Moon the gravitational pull is different which make your weight different.
STDT 2866,There is no gravity on the moon. Because of this you weigh less.
STDT 2870, A astronaut weight is way different on the moon then on our earth because our earth gravity pulls us down but on the moon gravity doesn't pull you down. 
STDT 2871," On Earth weight is different than in space because Earth has gravity. In space, gravity is different because there is no gravitational pull to pull you back down to the surface. "
STDT 2876, because moon gravity is different from earth gravity it is like the pool when your leg is in the water it is floating but as you raise it up it feels heavy .
STDT 2878, A astronauts weight is different on the moon because the different gravitational pull than the Earth . 
STDT 2880, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the moon has less gravity.  
STDT 2881, because they would weigh less than they do on earth
STDT 2883, . 
STDT 2886,A astronaut's weight would be less on the moon than it would be on earth because the moon is smaller and has a weaker gravitational force then the earth does because the earth is bigger so it has a stronger gravitational force.
STDT 2890,the mass of the moon is smaller so the earth is pulling it so it stays and the wight is keeping distance from the earth.
STDT 2893," The weight of an object becomes greater in a place with more gravity. In  a place of less gravity, the weight of an will be fewer. Therefore an astronaut will weigh less on the moon but their mass in both places will be the same."
STDT 2895, The reason is the weight on the moon is far less because of weaker gravitational force. 
STDT 2900, if i was on the moon my weight would go down because with the less  amount of mass it would bring down my weight and then you can say hey i lost weight  
STDT 2903, A Astronauts weight changes because there's  very little gravity on the moon so that's why there weight changes and makes them weigh less even though the Astronauts still have the same mass.
STDT 2904, The reason why the astronaut weights different on the moon than the earth is because the moon is smaller than earth and is 60% as dense and only weights one sixth of what it would be on the earth 
STDT 2905," The gravity on the moon is decreased as the mass is less than that of earths, so they would be lighter on the moon be gravity isn't pulling down as much! "
STDT 2906, An astronaut is lighter on the moon then the earth because the gravitational force on the moon is much lower than on earth. 
STDT 705," Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than Earth because weight is a measure of force, it requires an object to have both mass and gravity.  "
STDT 2912, The moon is smaller and less dense than the earth. It has less mass so it has less gravity. The astronaut weighs less because there is less gravitational force.  
STDT 2916," Their weight changed. It changed because the moon's gravity is less than Earth's an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on Earth, but their mass remains the same. "
STDT 2921,The astronaut weight will be less on the moon because it is smaller than the Earth. 
STDT 2924," the moons gravity is less than Earth's so they weigh less, because weight decreases when gravity decreases."
STDT 2927, Because in Earth we have gravity and in the moon we don't have Gravity 
STDT 2928, The astronaut's weight would change on the moon because the gravitational pull is not as strong as it is on earth. 
STDT 2942," Our weight on the moon is less on the moon and on earth our weight is more because of a difference of the strength of gravity, gravity force is determined by the mass and the size of the Planet you're on and where the Planet you're on is the solar system. "
STDT 2952," An astronauts weight would be different because on earth, the gravitational pull is stronger. "
STDT 2953," An astronaut's wight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because, our wieght on the moon is less that it is on earth due to the difference of the strength of gravity on the moon."
STDT 2955, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than earth is because the mass on the moon is less than the earth. And mass is part of gravity when 2 things full of mass are near gravity sticks them or pull them. There's not really gravity on moon because there's less mass. 
STDT 2958, On the moon the weight of the astronaut will be less because there is less gravity on the moon. His weight will be greater on the Earth. 
STDT 2962," it is like this every time you go up, you are less form earth and more in non gravitational space where there many things like asteroids. "
STDT 2964, they weigh is different because the moon has less gravity
STDT 2966," ,Because, there is no gravity on the moon. "
STDT 2967, An astronauts weight is different on the moon then on earth gravity pulls you down and on the moon there is no gravity. 
STDT 2975," The reason the astronaut's weight is different on the moon than the earth is because the moon is smaller than the earth so the gravity is lower. Also, you don't really weigh much on the moon because the gravitational force is weaker than earth's. "
STDT 2985," An astronaut's weight is different from it is in earth vs. space the reasoning behind that is, gravity if there is low gravity things are lighter if there is normal gravity everything is.. normal. "
STDT 2987, Because the gravity pull down less on the moon than earth. 
STDT 2989," On Earth there is more gravitational force so the astronaut's weighs more, but on the Moon there is less gravitational pull so the astronaut weighs less."
STDT 2991," In space, gravity is very different one person could be 60kg but on the moon, you would weigh 10kg your weight on the moon is 16.5% of what it would be on the earth. "
STDT 2992, He would weigh less on the moon because there is less gravity.
STDT 2995,Weight is a measuring of the pull of gravity on an object.Our weight on the moon is less than it would be in earth because of the difference in the force of gravity on the moon.
STDT 3006,Their weight changed but their mass didn't. The moon is smaller than the Earth and has a weaker gravitational pull and makes your weigh lighter. Your weight on the Moon is 16.5% what you would experience on Earth. Mass never changes.
STDT 3007, There would be more gravitational force because the planet has more mass. Your weight depends on mass and gravity. Your weight would change because there is more gravitational force. This would cause you to weigh more with more gravitational force.  
STDT 3009,Because the moon has less mass than earth. so it has less of a force on a person than earth does.
STDT 3012, The more you go up the lighter you are. Only Because on the moon they were able to jump higher than on earth. 
STDT 3013, Their is less gravity on the moon then their is on the earth causing anything on the moon to way less.
STDT 3017, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the mass of the moon is much less than the mass of the Earth. 
STDT 3030,They weigh less because the moon is smaller so it has less gravity.
STDT 3031, There is less gravity on the moon so an astronaut's weight would decrease.  
STDT 3032, There is less gravity on the moon but more gravity on earth so the astronaut's weight would be less on the moon even though his or her mass is the same in both places.
STDT 3039," In space there is no gravity, meaning that there is no gravitational force to pull an astronaut toward the moon. "
STDT 3042, because the moon is smaller then earth so it has a smaller  gravitational force causing less gravity                                                                                                                                                     
STDT 3048," An astronauts weight is different on the moon then earth because, on earth gravity pulls you down and on the moon it's not as much. "
STDT 3050,An astronauts weight is heavier on earth than the  moon because there is very little gravity on the moon.
STDT 3058," Earth's gravitational force is stronger than the moon's, therefore making you weigh more on Earth. You would weigh less on the moon because even though your mass is the same, the gravitational pull is weaker."
STDT 3059,"It is different because the moon has a different mass than Earth. Since Earth has more mass, it has more gravity, since the moon has less mass, it has less gravity, therefore making you lighter."
STDT 3062,"An astronauts weight is different on earth because of gravity. Gravity keeps things on the ground and stable. The reason it's different on the moon is because the moon doesn't have gravity to keep the human on the ground, therefore, making them float."
STDT 3064, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth is because there is a less gravitational force on the moon than there is on the Earth.
STDT 3065," The weight of the astronaut will increase in places where gravity is greater, (Earth) and decrease in places where gravity is lower. (Space) "
STDT 2545,"The reason why astronaut weight is different on the Moon than on Earth is because the amount of gravity on the Moon is 1.62m/s2  and the  gravity on Earth is 9.807m/s2, which means that on the Moon the astronaut weights less than what he or she weights on Earth. For example if on Earth an astronaut weighs 150 ibs than on the Moon i would weigh 24.80 ibs . So basically what im trying to say is that on the Moon astronauts have less mass."
STDT 3071, The weight of an astronaut is less on the moon than on Earth because the moon has a less amount of gravitational pull than Earth. 
STDT 3075,the gravity is less so there is less gravity pushing them down so les weight 
STDT 3077, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because there's no gravity on the moon. But on earth it is different because there is gravitational pull on earth.  
STDT 3078, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because ton the moon their is less gravity than on the Earth.
STDT 3081,"When, you get farther away from the earth your weight gets lighter so when you are so far away from the earth your weight will be lighter. Even if you 50 ft (ca. 15 m) above the ground your farther away from gravity so your lighter "
STDT 3083, It is because there is less gravity on the Moon then on Earth. So while on the moon you will be lighter then on Earth.
STDT 3086, ON THE MOON THAIR IS LES GRAVITY PULING DOWN ON YOU THAN ON EARTH 
STDT 3089, Beacause there is no gravity in space to pull us back downto earth and deacreses our weight. 
STDT 3090," Weight is the force of gravity on an object, therefore since there is more gravity on earth than the moon, on earth the astronauts weight would increase and in the moon the astronauts weight would decrease. "
STDT 3093,Because on earth there is gravity and in space there is no gravity. 
STDT 3094, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon then on earth because the moon is smaller then the earth. Because the earth is larger it has a stronger gravitational pull. The moon has less gravitational pull so the astronauts weight decreases on the moon. 
STDT 3100,an astronauts weights lesser on moon when compared to earth therefore a person would be much lighter on the moon.
STDT 3102, In Earth there is more gravitational force than on the moon. So you would have more weigh on earth than on the moon. 
STDT 3109," When they are on earth there is gravity but on the moon there is no gravity, so their weight will be less.     "
STDT 3112, Here on earth there is gravity that keeps us down on the ground. But in space there is no gravity u just float! So without gravity you are lighter. Then when you are on earth you are forced to the ground. 
STDT 3114,It is different because earth has gravity that make us heavier.
STDT 3116,"There is more gravitational pull on Earth than there is on the moon.  This means that the amount of weight that your body has will change, but your mass will remain the same.  You will be heavier on Earth than you will on the moon. "
STDT 3120, there is less gravity on the moon
STDT 3121,The moon has less gravity than the Earth. This means that an astronaut would weigh less on the moon because there is less gravitational force pulling on the astronaut than there would be on Earth.
STDT 3123,"The astronaut's weight will be different because if there is less gravitational pull on moon,  them the astronaut's weight will be lighter."
STDT 3125," Learning from my lesson the reason why the astronauts's weight will change when on the moon is because the weight of a person depends on mass as well as gravity.   So if the moon has less gravity than earth, that is why the person's weight will change. "
STDT 3137, The astronauts weight is different on the moon then on earth because the moon has less gravitational pull then the Earth does. 
STDT 3142, The earth is bigger in mass and the moon is smaller in mass. His weight will be heavier on the earth. He'll be lighter on the moon. Gravity on the moon is less than earth. 
STDT 3143," I think it is because of weight, in a meaning that weight is your measure when it comes to how much you weigh on the moon, and also because on the moon there is less gravity meaning you'll weigh less.  "
STDT 3148, because weight is a measure of force so if there's less force on the moon the astronauts going to weigh less compared to earth where there's more force.
STDT 3156,An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the Moon is smaller than Earth so it has a weaker gravitational pull.
STDT 3164, The astronaut's weight on the moon is different because there less gravity. 
STDT 3168,"There is no gravity in space, so when you hop you go higher than how we jump on Earth. Earth have gravity and with the gravity you can't jump as high "
STDT 1798, because the moon is smaller than the earth and about 60 percent as dense the astronaut weight is only about one-sixth of what it would be on earth. 
STDT 3171,  An Astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the moon has less of a gravitational pull which causes  him or her to have less weight but his or hers mass stays the same. 
STDT 3172," Because it has smaller mass, and it is farther away from other planets. "
STDT 3178, Yes because there is less gravity. so the astronauts weight would be different. 
STDT 3179, There is more gravity on earth than there is on the moon.
STDT 3183," Well your weight increases on a Earth because you have more gravity there, and   it decreases on the moon sense you have less gravity."
STDT 3187, Their weight changes because the gravitational pull is lower on the moon.B
STDT 3190,An astronaut's weight changes because of the gravity. On earth he or she would weigh a lot cause of gravity but in space their weight decrees cause there is no gravitiy.
STDT 3203," On earth, they weigh more because gravity pulls them down onto the ground which makes them weigh more, but in space they really don't get pulled down to the ground, so they don't weigh nearly as much.Their mass will always remain the same. "
STDT 3206,The gravitational pull of the moon is much less than it is on earth and a person Weighs less on the moon
STDT 3208, Earth has more mass than the moon because earth is larger. Earths gravity is stronger than the moons. Earth gravity pulls you down and makes you heavier. The astronaut would feel light because there is less gravity pulling him down. So the astronaut would be lighter on the moon.  
STDT 3294," It is because the gravity on the moon and the earth are different. On the moon there's less gravity there, making people weight less, but on earth there is more gravity, causing people to weigh more. "
STDT 3301, the reason an astronauts weight is different on the moon is because there is less gravitaional pull on the moon than on earth 
STDT 3306," The astronauts weight is different on the moon than on earth because on earth there is gravity, so he is being pulled down by gravity and on the moon there is no gravity so the astronaut is lighter "
STDT 3307, There is more gravity on Earth than in space. 
STDT 3310, The weight is different on the moon than  the Earth because of gravity. The more mass the more it weights so therefore the mass on earth is more than on the moon so it weighs differently.  
STDT 3313, Since weight needs mass and gravity to work. The astronaut would be lighter on the moon because there is less gravity than compared to the earth. That means that an astronaut would be multiple pounds lighter.  
STDT 3314, Because the astronaut is farther from earth making the gravity less powerful. 
STDT 3316," Since weight is in the force of gravity it can act on an object causing the gravity to increase mass of the planet. If there were an astronaut to travel, the earth would obviously have more mass. The astronaut would not be able to move because of the mass on the planet, and because of how much of the astronaut is accelerating, that would make the astronaut weigh ore, and the earth less because of how much mass there is. "
STDT 3317, On earth you have more mass and gravity. On the moon you have mass yet less gravity. 
STDT 3320, The astronauts weight is different because the gravitational pull is different because the mass is less than the earths mass. 
STDT 3321, There is no gravity on the moon. That's why an astronaut's weight is different than on Earth.     
STDT 3322, The weight of one individual on the moon differs from when they are on Earth because of the different strength of gravity that the moon has. This why an astronauts weight would weigh less than they would if they were on Earth. 
STDT 3323, Astronuants weight less on the moonBecause on the moon (or space) there is less gravity than on the earth so you will just float in the air when your on the moon 
STDT 3324," The mass of the Earth's Moon is much smaller than that of the Earth itself. In addition, the gravitational attraction on the Moon is much lower than on Earth, so an individual weighs less there. "
STDT 3327, The weight in the moon is different then in earth . 
STDT 3329," Earth has more gravity than the moon, so on the moon they would be  much lighter. "
STDT 3337," All objects on the Moon weigh so much less than they do on the Earth. This is because the gravitational field strength or weight is much less. For example, astronauts can jump a lot higher when they are on the moon than when they are on Earth.   "
STDT 3340, Our weight on earth is more than on the moon and our weight on the moon is less because gravitation force is determined by the mass and size.  
STDT 3342, The reason an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the moon has less gravitational pull so you have less weight. This is because on earth we have gravity pulling us down to the grown rather say floating in space. 
STDT 3347," Weight is the amount or force of gravity on an object. Since the Earth has more gravity than the moon, you weigh less than you would on Earth because gravity is taken off of you. And since you don't have much gravity, you don't way much. "
STDT 3348," An astronaut's weight is less on the moon because weight is determined by the amount of gravity so the less gravity, the less weight. The moon has a weaker gravitational pull than Earth so and astronaut's weight would be less on the moon. "
STDT 3349, The reason why an astronaut weight is different on the moon is because of mater and weight are two different types of measurements. 
STDT 1283, Astronauts weight is less on the moon then on earth due to the gravity on the moon the moons gravitation force is deermined by the mass and size of the moon. 
STDT 3352, An astronaut's weight is less on the moon because the moon has a weaker gravitational pull. 
STDT 3354," Astronauts' weights are different on the moon because the moon is smaller than the earth, which means there is less mass, and the gravitational attraction is less than on earth, making the astronauts' weight less. "
STDT 3357,"       If you are on earth, your mass is gonna be the same, and your weight is too, but then you wanted to take a trip to the moon. Your weight starts changing by decreasing. This is because gravity is different in other locations.  Gravity is going to change, like on the moon. There isn't much gravity. For example: if you jump you land slowly because gravity isn't pushing you down to the ground. Because there isn't much gravity, your weight decreases but your mass will stay the same. "
STDT 3359, The gravity on the moon is way less than the Earth's gravity. So the gravity makes you lighter on the moon. 
STDT 3363," An astronaut weighs less on the moon because the moon has a smaller gravitational pull than the Earth does, which means the moon has a smaller mass. When an object is smaller than another, it has a less gravitational pull. "
STDT 3364, because gravity is weaker in space. 
STDT 3369," On earth the weight on the astronaut is large, but on the moon its weight is smaller than earth. "
STDT 3370," Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because weight is a measure of force. On earth, your mass is in kilograms, and your weight will be in pounds. weight is the force of gravity on an object. The weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. "
STDT 3371, An astronaut will weigh less on the moon than on Earth. This is because the mass is less up in space. 
STDT 3380," The moon has less mass than the Earth, and therefore it is not as affected by gravity as the Earth. "
STDT 3384, There is no gravity on the moon and there is gravity on earth. That is why the astronauts' weight is different on the moon than on earth. 
STDT 1332," Simply, the moon is smaller and the earth is way bigger. then the moon. "
STDT 3392, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the earth because gravity on the moon is different than on the earth. It depends on where you are to tell if the gravity will be the same.   
STDT 3399, The astronaut's weight changed because the gravitational pull on the moon is less powerful than the gravity on the earth. The reason why the moon has a less powerful gravitational pull is because of mass. The Moon's mass is comparable to mercury. 
STDT 3406, The moon has less mass then earth. 
STDT 3408, Astronauts weight is different on the moon because the moon is smaller than earth so it has less gravitational pull on the Astronaut but his or her mass stays the same. 
STDT 3415," The Moon's gravitational force is only about 16.6% of Earth gravity , it means that a person would weight six time less on the moon than they do on Earth. A 45-kilogram person would weight 100lbs,on Earth but only 16.6 lbs. The gravity on Moom is is less than in Earth. The weight of an object on the Moon is 1/6th it's Leighton the Eart. "
STDT 3420, I think the weight is different on the moon compared to the moon because the moon has barely gravitational force and there is no air in space. 
STDT 3422," The moon has less mass than the earth, making it have less gravitational force than the earth. "
STDT 3424, the gravity causes the weight to be lighter 
STDT 3427, Earth is bigger so it has a stronger gravitational pull making an astronaut heavier 
STDT 3433," On the moon the astronaut's weight decreases, but the astronaut's mass stays the same. "
STDT 3436, An astronauts weight on the Moon is less than it is on Earth because there is less gravity on the Moon than there is on Earth. 
STDT 3438, The weight of astronauts on earth is different on the moon because the mass on earth and on the moon are the same. Though the gravity on the moon is less than the gravity on earth. 
STDT 3443, An astronauts has more weight on earth and less weight on the moon because less mass the less gravity and on the earth and the moon the mass is different so the astronauts has more weight on earth because the mass is more and on the moon its less 
STDT 3444, There is less gravitational force on the moon so people seem lighter on the moon then earth. 
STDT 3454," An Astronaut's weight is different on the moon because of the force of Gravity   on the moon, unlike the force of Gravity on Earth. "
STDT 3455, Every mass in the universe attracts every other mass in the universe  with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the two masses involved  . moon is weighless compared to the earth. 
STDT 3457, Astronauts weight is different on the moon because your weight changes depending on where you are. You could weigh 125 pounds on Earth and only 30 pounds on the moon. 
STDT 3458," The weight is different because on earth you have more gravity so it puts more mass to your body, as on the moon there is less gravity. Even though you weigh the same amount on earth and moon the gravity makes it different in both places. "
STDT 3464, The astronaut's weight will increase on earth and decrease on the moon because the gravitational force. 
STDT 3470, The weight is different on the moon because there is less gravity and when there is more gravity like on earth they will be heavier. For example if i was on earth i would be 120 pounds if i was on the moon with less gravity i would be less then 120 pounds. 
STDT 3477, The reason why the moon's gravity is different than the earth's is because the mass of the moon is much less than the earth's.  
STDT 3479," The moon's gravity is weaker than that of the Earth's, so less gravity pulling down on the astronaut means free weight loss! "
STDT 3481, It is different because the gravitational force is not as strong the farther the astronaut moves from earth. 
STDT 3482," The weight is different because the gravity is decreased on moon and increased on earth, more gravity more weight, less gravity, less weight "
STDT 3483, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the weight of the astronaut increases on earth because there is more gravity on eart than there is on the moon.  
STDT 3484, The stronger the force of gravity means there is more weight (like on Earth) but the least amount of gravity the less you weigh (like on the Moon). 
STDT 3486," Their weight is different because on earth there is more gravitational force than there is on the moon, so if you jump you will fall down quicker on earth because you weigh more than you would on the moon because the gravitational force is lower than earth's.    "
STDT 3488, An astronaut's weight is different because there is less gravity on the moon. 
STDT 3490, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because of the gravitational pull and other forces that cause it. 
STDT 3493, Because the mass and weight on earth are different from the mass and weight on the moon. 
STDT 1491, because there is a lot less gravity on the moon and in space in genaral 
STDT 3494, the weight of the astronaut increases with more gravity in its location but it decreases while its its in place. 
STDT 3496, It is different because there is more of a gravitational pull on Earth then the Moon. 
STDT 3497," The astronauts' weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth, because the moon has a weaker                             gravitational pull,and it's smaller in size.     "
STDT 3498," By definition, weight is the force of gravity on an object. The astronauts' weight is more on Earth because Earth has more gravity and less on the moon because the moon's gravity is less than Earth's. The weight of the astronaut will vary depending on the gravity of the location, but the mass will remain the same.  "
STDT 3499, the moon has less gravity than earth   
STDT 3501," The astronauts' weight is different when on the moon or the earth because the mass is different for each planet. In this case, the moon has less mass, so it gives the astronaut less weight. :) "
STDT 3505," When an astronaut is on earth his/her weight would be regular because earth has mass and gravity. On the moon his/her weight would be different because the moon has mass but it doesn't have gravity. Weight depends on mass and gravity, so since the moon doesn't have gravity its different from it is on earth. "
STDT 3506, the astronauts mass changes  
STDT 3514, On Earth an astronaut's weight would be 196 pounds (88.9 kg). On the Moon their weight would be 5 pounds (2.27 kg)   
STDT 3516, It is diffrent because there isnt any gravity there. 
STDT 3518, Because of gravity on earth is very high every thing that go's up comes down but in space every thing that go's up doesn't come down until it hits something that will make it go down but on the moon some times it will let you go down it will just be slow though 
STDT 3521," First, of all the way to increase gravity is the force of it. This means in simple terms that if theres more force your weight increases like in earth. but in the moon there isnt a lot of force so your weight deacreses. So basically earth has more force which means you way more and the moon doesnt haave as much force as the earth thays why you way less.    Bonus of what i learned mass doesnt change wherever you are like if youre ron the moon it doesnt change if your on earth it doesnt change. "
STDT 3523, An astronaut weight would be different because the moon has less gravity and so the astronaut his weight would be less then what it is on earth. 
STDT 3527, Your weight is different on earth because of gravity. Gravity is basically all your weight. On the moon your weight decreases because there is no gravity on the moon. 
STDT 3535, The astronaut's weight is different because the moon has no gravity so the astronaut's weight is less. While on Earth astronaut's weight more because there is gravity and gravity pulls you down.  
STDT 3540, The gravitational pull of the Moon is not as strong as the Earth because the Moon's mass is not as big as Earth's. 
STDT 3541, because the moon has less gravity 
STDT 3546, Because thing on the moon weight less then they do on earth meaning they can jump higher.Weight is not the same on the moon then is on earth because gravity acts different the gravitational attraction from the moon is allot less one person weighs less on the moon then they do here. 
STDT 3548, An astronauts weight is different on the moon then earth because on earth gravity pulls you down and on the moon it 
STDT 3553, Because there is no gravity on the moon. 
STDT 3556," The reason for the change in astronauts' weight depending on what planet they are on is due to the planet's gravitational force. Objects that have a small amount of mass have less of a gravitational pull compared to objects larger in mass because mass and distance are the two key factors that make up gravitational attraction. This means that Earth, a planet with a mass of 5.9722 x 10 24  kilograms, will have a stronger gravitational pull than the Moon, with a mass of 7.34767309 × 10 22  kilograms. "
STDT 3557," If I was an astronaut going to a bigger planet than earth, my weight level would increase from the weight on earth.Because the mass of the planet would be greater than earth so my weight would be greater as well. "
STDT 3563," The moon's mass is less than half of the earth, so the gravitational force is way less compared to earth. And the astronaut is closer to the moon so the moon takes the astronaut. Because the moon's mass is so small, it will have less off a force on us, making us lighter. "
STDT 3566, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because gravity changes on location.The Earths gravity is greater than the moon's gravity so the astronauts weight is different. The mass of the astronaut stays the same but the force is different because of the gravity difference. 
STDT 3577, Because the  gravity  on the moon and mass. Mass  and weight  affects the force of gravity. It affects how much the astronaut's weight is! 
STDT 3578," You weigh different on the moon because the moon is smaller on then earth so the moon has less gravity,Then on earth you will weigh more because it has more gravity.   "
STDT 3580," Since weight is the force of gravity on an object, the weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less.So the moon is at a gravitational force on the earth, so it has less gravity.Also, the earth has more gravity.   "
STDT 3581, cuz there is less gravity. 
STDT 3582, The astronauts weight would be different on the moon that on it would be on earth because  the moon has less gravity than the Earth . 
STDT 3584," on the moon, weight is kg and on earth we are measured as pounds. "
STDT 2165," The reason that the weight is different is because there is no gravity on the moon, but on earth, there is gravity.  "
STDT 3590," Weight is the force of gravity, and because of that, the weight of the astronaut increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less gravity. Because the moon has weak gravity, the astronaut's weight decreases.  "
STDT 3592, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because the gravitational pull is not as strong because of the distance.  
STDT 3596," The Earth is bigger than the Moon, so it has more mass and the larger the mass, the larger the gravitational pull or force is, so we are heavier, unlike on the Moon. It is smaller, so you are lighter because there is less of a pull. "
STDT 3597," astronaut weight is different on moon than earth is because of the distance,because the moon is way closer to the earth so the force of gravity is stronger. an astronaut weight on the moon , because of it mass. astronaut weight is different of earth because of its gravity. "
STDT 3599," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because there is no gravity on the moon, so it will lift some of the weight of the astronaut when the astronaut goes back on earth where there is gravity the astronaut will force their weight on the ground. So there would be more weight on earth than in space. "
STDT 3600, Moon has no gravity 
STDT 3601," An astronaut weighs less on earth because earth has a stronger gravity than the moon's. In other words, the weight on earth is the relation between the mass and the gravity force that pushes down on the matter. "
STDT 3611," In the moon, the weight of an astronaut will be 29 ibis ( 129N), but on the earth it'll be 175 ibis ( 129 N ). "
STDT 3614, An astronaut weight is different on the moon because the moon has less mass than Earth. This means that the astronaut will weigh less. 
STDT 3615, Since weight is the force of gravety the weight increases in a place with more gravety and goes down on a place with less gravety.  The moon gravety is smaler than earts so austronaut way less on the moon then they would on earth but ither mass remains the same. 
STDT 3617, because weight is a force of gravity and the moon has less gravity than the earth. 
STDT 3618, it is because in space their is no gravity and so it makes astronaut's jump high but on earth yo don't jump that high. and their is gravity on earth 
STDT 3628," On earth our mass is measured in kilograms and your weight is measured in pounds mass refers to the amount of matter in an object. Weight is the force experienced by an object due to gravity. Since weight depends on both mass and gravity, it changed depending on location. "
STDT 3633," This is because the moon has less mass meaning less gravity. However, the earth has a greater amount of mass meaning it has a stronger gravitational force and more gravity. Since the moon has less mass it has less force. Weight is based on force meaning his weight would decrease. "
STDT 3637, It is different because the gravitational pull of the moon is weaker than the one on the earth 
STDT 3640," Weight is mass with gravity, so if gravity changes, the weight would too. The moon has a smaller mass than the Earth, so it would have less gravity, making the astronaut weigh less. "
STDT 3642, Since Weight is the Force of Gravity on an Object the Weight of an Object Increases In Location with more gravity and decreases In A Place with Less. 
STDT 3647, An astronauts weight is different on the moon than Earth because on earth gravity pulls us down. On the moon we flot making us lighter. 
STDT 3651, Because the moon has less gravity than earth so the gravity will on earth pulls you down more than it does in the moon. And this is what we call weight. 
STDT 3652, It is different on the moon than on Earth because of the gravitational force. Since the Earth is bigger is has more gravity but the moon is smaller so it has less. 
STDT 3653, They don't weigh anything because they can just float. The only difference is between mass and weight.  
STDT 3654, they have a different gravitional pull on the moon because there is less gravity so less gravity means they weigh less 
STDT 3655," The astronaut's weight is less on the moon than on Earth. This is because the mass of the moon is less than the mass of Earth, which makes the gravitational pull on the moon less than on Earth. "
STDT 3656," an astronauts wheight is different on the moon than it is on earth because weight is an application of weight, and the moon has less gravity. "
STDT 3657," Astronaut's weight is different on the moon because there is no gravitational pull on the moon. The reason why, is that the Moon's surface is weaker because it has less mass than Earth. Earth has a thicker and stronger surface. That is why we have gravity today. "
STDT 3659," Because the weight of the astronauts is different on the earth and on the moon, because on earth there is a force of gravity and on the moon there is no gravity. "
STDT 3676," Because your weight increases and decreases in different locations, and the Moon has less gravity than the Earth. "
STDT 3677," The astronaut's weight depends on the location's gravity, and the moon's gravity doesn't pull you down as much as the earth's gravity. "
STDT 3680," Because the mass of the moon is different than the mass of the earth, therefore the gravitational force on the astronaut's different on the moon than on the earth.  "
STDT 3682, The earth has more gravity and the moon has less gravity. 
STDT 3688, AN astronuats weight is different  on the moon than on earth is because  our net weight is less on the moon than we are on earth. so in theory  the reason we weigh less on the moon is because our newtons are different on the moon than on earth 
STDT 3693, the moon has less gravity than the earth the earth has more gravity than the moon so on the moon the weight would decrease. 
STDT 3699," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth, because earth has gravity and the moon has zero gravity. Not just the moon, space itself has zero gravity. So the weight of the astronaut is different on the moon than on earth.   "
STDT 3701," Mass refers to the amount of matter in an object, but weight is the force experienced by an object due to gravity. Because weight depends on both gravity and mass, it can change in different locations. On the moon, there is less gravity than there is on Earth. When you have more gravity, your weight will increase, and when you have less your weight will decrease. So, your weight would be lower on the moon, then it is on Earth. "
STDT 3703," If an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth, if you are on the moon, your weight is less than yours on earth, but your mass is going to be the same. "
STDT 3705, There is gravity on earth  
STDT 3710," because, there is less gravity on the moon then on earth.  and due to the earth's bigger mass that's why there is more gravity on the earth then on the moon. "
STDT 3715, Since the moon is smaller than the earth it has a weaker gravitational pull. This means you would weigh less on the moon than you would on earth. 
STDT 3720," An astronaut's weight is less on the moon because the moon is smaller, therefore giving a smaller gravitational force. "
STDT 3725," well, the gravitational attraction on the moon is much less than it is here on the earth. Also, a person on the moon weighs less on the moon. "
STDT 3726, Astronauts may feel weightless on the moon because there is no force pushing or pulling on there body. 
STDT 3729," The astronauts weight is different on the moon than the Earth because the moon has less mass which mean less gravity and when the gravity is lower the astronauts will be lighter on the moon, and they can jump higher and kind of float for a short period of time. "
STDT 3731," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because on the moon there is less gravity than on Earth. Therefore, on the Earth the gravitational force pulls down while on the moon the gravitational force does not pull. "
STDT 3732, There is less gravity/pressure on the moon then on earth. 
STDT 3736," An astronaut's weight is different on the Moon because of the big gravitational difference between the two planets. Earth has a lot more gravitational force than the Moon. The Moon has only one sixth / about 16% of the Earth's gravity, making you weigh about 83.5% less when you go to the Moon.    "
STDT 3737," the weight is different, cause of the gravitational pull, on each place "
STDT 3738, An astronaut weight is different on the moon than it is on the earth because the earth has more gravity then the moon. This makes the astronaut weight less on the moon making him float.
STDT 3739, On Earth there is gravity and on the moon there is no gravity. Weight increases with more gravity. 
STDT 3741, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because of the gravitational pull. 
STDT 3744, The weight of an object will be decreased sense it is further from the gravity of Earth. 
STDT 3747," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon because on the moon there is more gravity, and weight is the force experienced by an object due to gravity. Therefore, the astronaut's weight is lighter. "
STDT 3753," Their weight is different because there is less gravitational force, however there mass dose not chang  "
STDT 3758," The moon is smaller and has less mass than the earth, so the astronaut's weight would decrease while being on the moon.  "
STDT 3759, Some places have less gravity and gravity gives you weight. Earth has more gravity than the moon they have less weight. 
STDT 3760," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because there is less gravity on the moon than on Earth, so the astronaut's weight is different because there is less gravity pulling him/her down. "
STDT 3761," An astronaut's weight on the moon is different than it is on the Earth because of the mass of the Moon being less than the Earth. Therefore, the gravitational pull on us would be less, furthermore allowing us to be lighter than on Earth. "
STDT 3768," Because the gravity on the moon is less than on Earth, it makes the astronaut's weight smaller there than on Earth. So, if the astronaut's weight on Earth was 200 lbs, then he or she's weight on the moon would be 33 lbs. That is because the gravity is lower on the moon than it is on Earth. "
STDT 3774, there is no gravity in space 
STDT 3775, The reason why the weight on the moon is different than the weight on earth is because there is less gravity on the moon.  Weight changes depending on it's location.  Objects on the moon will weigh less than if it was on earth even if they have the same mass. 
STDT 3777, because the moon has more mass and on the moon it is lower gravity than on earth. 
STDT 3778, because weight depends upon gravity and mass but gravity on earth differs from gravity on the moon 
STDT 3780, because there is a different in gravity 
STDT 3783, your mass stays the same on both the moon and earth because gravity is less on the moon then on the earth you way much less on the moon. 
STDT 3785," The reason an astronaut's weight is different on earth is because there is more gravity but the moon has less gravity, causing the astronaut to seem lighter.  "
STDT 3788," When you are on the moon there is not a lot of gravity. And when you are on Earth there is gravity. So when on the moon you don't have a lot of weight on you. Like say, you weigh 129 pounds but on the moon you would weigh 29 pounds!  "
STDT 3790, the man weighs less on the moon because of gravity and distance. the farther you get from earth the less you weigh. 
STDT 3791, the moon has less mass 
STDT 3794, Your weight is 1/6 on the moon than your weight on earth. 
STDT 3795, Because weight is measurement of force and needs mass and gravity and there is no gravity up in space. 
STDT 3802, An astronaut/s weight is diffrent because they dont have as much gravatational force on them. 
STDT 3804, The moon have less gravity so you don't weigh the same as u do on earth  
STDT 3806, because things on the moon dont weigh as much on earth because of the gravitational field. 
STDT 3807," The Earth's Moon has considerably less mass than the Earth itself. And also the gravitational attraction on the Moon is much less than it is here on Earth, and a person weighs less on the Moon. "
STDT 3808, your weight is less 
STDT 3811, I think they will weigh less on the moon because of the mass and the size of the moon. 
STDT 3903, An astronaughts weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth is because the moon have less mass than the Earth. So the gravity is less on the moon. 
STDT 3907, An astronauts weight is different on the Moon rather than on Earth because the Moon is smaller and has less mass. 
STDT 3908, the moon has more gravity that means you weigh less but you mass stay's the same 
STDT 3920,"  The weight is the force of gravity on an object. The weight increases in a place with more gravity, and decreases in a place with less. There is less gravity in space than it is on Earth, so the astronaut's weight decreased. "
STDT 3921, There is not very much gravity on the moon therefore you will not weigh as much on the moon. 
STDT 3922, An astronaut weighs less on the moon because it has less gravity than earth. 
STDT 3925, A anstronaut weight is different on the moon then on Earth because on the moon because the gravity it greater on the moon. On Earth the gravity (gravitional force) lighter so the gravity decreases. 
STDT 3930, Because earth has gravity that means that a gravitational force is pulling you and making you stay on the grown and not float away and when you are in space there isn't any gravity so you could just float away and also means you wouldn't weigh anything in space because there is not any gravity in space. 
STDT 3931, The moon does not have gravity but the earth does. 
STDT 3933," It is because on the moon, there is less gravity, so their weight will change. Their mass won't change because gravity doesn't affect it.   "
STDT 3934," An astronaut's weight on the moon is different from it is on earth because the mass of the moon is smaller than the mass of the earth so, the gravitational pull of the moon is less. Less gravitational pull means less weight. "
STDT 3941, The earth's gravity is different from the moon's. Weight is measured by force. It requires both mass and gravity.  
STDT 3944, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the Earth because on Earth the weight and mass are greater because of the gravity because the gravity is less on the moon so the weight and mass is less. 
STDT 3953, the astronaut's weight would decrease because the gravitational force decrease'es on the moon 
STDT 3954, The reason you weight less on the moon is because the moon has less mass then on earth. 
STDT 3956," There is more gravity on planets, but there is less gravity when there are no planets near you. "
STDT 3957,It’s different on the moon because on earth gravity pulls you down and and in the moon not really .
STDT 3958,On earth an astronaut may weight 175 pounds (778N).On the moon the same astronaut would weigh only 29 pounds (129N).It is the difference mass refers to the amount of matter in an object .but weight is force experienced by an object due to gravity.
STDT 3959," Weight is the force of gravity on an object. The weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. Since the moon's gravity is less than Earth's, an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on Earth, but his or her mass remains the same. "
STDT 1927, It weighs different because of gravity and the farther they go the less they weight. 
STDT 3970," There is more gravitational force on the moon than on earth, so on the moon we would way less. "
STDT 3978," Astronauts weight depends on their location, it depends on location because weight is the force of gravity on an object. The weight increases when there is more gravity and decreases when there is less gravity. A large object like earth has more gravitational pull on an astronaut than the moon. This makes the astronauts weigh less on the moon than on the earth.  "
STDT 3979," Well, the moon is a lot smaller than the Earth, so on the moon, I would weigh much less than I would on Earth."
STDT 3983,"An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the moon has less gravity than earth. Weight relies on gravity and mass, so, if the gravity changes, the weight of the astronaut changes as well. "
STDT 3989, The astronaut would be weightless on the moon because there is no gravity. The earth has gravity/ 
STDT 3991, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because the weight of different objects increase when they are located on a spot with more gravity but when objects in a place with less gravity the weight decreases
STDT 4002,Its because the Moon has less gravity then the Earth and thats why is an astronaut weighed less on the Moon.
STDT 4023," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because of gravity, the less gravity a place has, the less weight.    "
STDT 4028, On Earth à astronaut Wright is heavier than it is on the moon the reason why is because of gravity 
STDT 4029, He or she would weight different on the moon than on the Earth because the Earth has more gravitational force than the moon .So the moon is smaller than the Earth.
STDT 4033,"Weight is affected by gravity, so if you are on the moon, you will lose weight, due to there not being as much gravity."
STDT 4057, the moon has lower gravity than on earth 
STDT 4071," An Astronauts weight would be different in space because there is no Gravity. So you will be flying around. On Earth we have gravity, down on the ground you carry weight, and if you have your regular weight  will bring you down and that's why astronaut's weight is different on the moon then the it is on earth. "
STDT 4074, The reason why in astronauts wait is different on the is becucse because on earth there's gravity to pull mass down  there weightless because of gravity 
STDT 4075," An astronaut's weight in space is measured by mass, or the amount of matter in the body. His weight on earth is measured by his body's mass and the Earth's gravitational pull. "
STDT 4077, Because the moon has less mass than earth and has less gravity. The astronaut weights less on the moon than on earth. 
STDT 4081," An Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because there is less gravity, so the astronaut is lighter on the moon and heavier on Earth because there is more gravity on Earth. "
STDT 4082," On earth, let's say an astronaut weighs 175 lbs.  On the moon, he or she would weigh 29 lbs. The reason for this is because the moon does not have the same amount of gravity as the earth and the more the gravity the more the weight.  "
STDT 4131, Because the gravity is different on the moon 
STDT 4133, Your weight increases in a place with more gravity and decreases in a place with less gravity. Since the moon has less gravity than the earth you would weigh less on the moon. 
STDT 4137," the moon is smaller than earth, so its gravitational pull is weaker"
STDT 4148, an astronauts weight is diffrent because there is alot less gravity on the moon than there is earth so the astronaut would weight less 
STDT 4150, An astronaut's will weigh less on the moon because the gravity is loose.
STDT 4151," The astronaut would weigh less on the moon, since there is less gravity on the moon compared to the earth. "
STDT 4152,"  The text states ""the weight of the astronaut increases in different locations with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. So the astronaut will weigh less on the moon than on Earth, but their mass is the same. "
STDT 4154," An astronaut's weight is different on the Moon because the mass on the Moon is less than the mass on Earth, therefore an object's weight on Earth is more than its weight on the Moon. "
STDT 4158, The moon has a smaller pull then earth. 
STDT 4159, weight depends on both mass and gravity. the weight and gravity in space are different from how they are on earth
STDT 4168," because there is no gravity on the moon, so it doesn't matter what the astronaut weighs they will still float like a feather.  "
STDT 4173, The moon has low gravity to no gravity witch would leave you floating around every  where . But when you come back to earth where we have a lot of mass and gravity you want float on more .
STDT 4174,the moon gravity is less then earth  so an astronaut weight less on the moon than on earth
STDT 4201,"An astronaut's weight on the moon is much lighter than on earth because the moon has much less mass, therefore having less gravity. And because weight is the combination of mass and gravity, the astronaut will weigh less with the weaker gravity."
STDT 4218," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the gravity on the moon is less than the gravity on Earth, so the astronaut doesn't have as much gravitational force. "
STDT 4220, It changes based on the gravitational force of the location.
STDT 4222," An astronaut would weight less on the moon because there is less gravity on the moon. When the gravity is smaller, the smaller the weight. But the mass is the same.  "
STDT 4228," An astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth since there isn't as much gravity on the moon, and that changes the weight of the astronaut. "
STDT 4229, Because there is less gravity on the moon than there is on Earth. 
STDT 4233,the weight of an object increases in a place with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. 
STDT 4235, there is less gravity on the moon 
STDT 4237,                   On the Earth there is gravity. that holds you down when you rest but in Space their is no gravity to hold you down and when you try to rest you just flote. 
STDT 4238, An astronauts weight is different on the moon then earth because on earth gravity pulls you down and on the moon it's not as much.
STDT 4242," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because the mass of the moon is a lot smaller, so the gravitational pull is less than earth's gravitational pull. Even is the astronaut's mass is the same. "
STDT 4257, the less gravity the less you weigh because there is less gravity pulling you down  
STDT 4275,"on earth there is more gravitational force than the moon, leading to the astronaut having more weight on earth"
STDT 4290, Earth is not that far out allowing the astronaut to have gravity but the moon is further then earth resulting in a decrease of gravity and weight. 
STDT 4296, there is less gravity on the moon than on the earth 
STDT 4299,"An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth, because the Moon has less mass than the Earth. The gravitational pull on the Moon is much weaker than on Earth, which will make the astronaut lighter."
STDT 4309, Astronaut's weight is different on the moon because of mass and force there wight changes on the moon but if they go back to earth its wight will stay the same like ayaws due to gravity force   
STDT 4311," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because, the moon has less gravity than the earth. Meaning if they were to go, to space to head to the moon,they would have the ability to float and jump higher then they could on earth,ETC-. That is why,an astronaut's weight is affected on the moon to be lighter. "
STDT 4312,  It depends on the mass and if there is gravity. Something will weigh less if there is no gravity like on the moon and it will weigh more if there is gravity like on the earth. 
STDT 4319," an astronaut's weight would be different on the moon due to the gravitational force being different than here on earth, although their mass would remain the same. "
STDT 4322," Well,the astronaut weight changes when moving away from earth like, when its on earth its weighs a good wait but when he or she goes into space their weight changes(goes down,they start to weigh less then normal) like,they weigh 175 when they go to  space then the farther they go in space the less they weigh,then there farther they weigh 25 then they are really deep in space and they don't weigh anything but throw out this there mass has stayed the same it stayed 75. "
STDT 4324," Its because of the moons distance , because the moon is further a way from the sun your weight changes."
STDT 4330,"  On earth, your weight is measured in pounds. Weight depends on mass and gravity, it changes depending on location.  "
STDT 4331, An astronauts weight is different on the moon then it is on Earth because the Earth's mass is greater so gravity is stronger. 
STDT 4334,because in earth has more mass than the moon and also the space suit is really heavy on earth and on the moon is very lite 
STDT 4353, The weight of an astronaut is lighter on the moon as there is no gravity in space and it is the gravitational pull of the earth which determines the weight of all beings 
STDT 4354," To begin, the power of gravity holds everything down at all times. When the astronaut is on earth, they have pounds of meat on their bodies. As we all eat food, it is transported to our digestive system, which gives meat to the body. What also matters is height. We all have height differences, so that also gives us more weight to the body. On earth, gravity is the reason why we sit, can't jump insanely high, and stay on the ground! We have gravity pushing down on us at all times. When an astronaut goes into space towards the moon, they're going to be 10x lighter. It makes sense why. That is because there is no gravity pushing down so that the astronaut's weight inside their body isn't pushing down and not heavy anymore. It lightens the body, and space also has no possible air to breathe in. As the body isn't in breathable air, nor gravity, it makes the astronaut's body float. The moon has no supportive air, it also has no gravity, so the astronaut can jump really high! That is why the astronaut's body is heavier on the moon than on earth. "
STDT 4355,"The reason the astronaut's weight is different on the moon then on earth is because there is less mass on the moon, therefor less gravity. "
STDT 4357,"Because on the moon, the force of gravity is lesser than the force of gravity on earth, and because weight is the measure of how much gravity effects you, the astronaut will weigh less on the moon."
STDT 4364, The weight is different because in space there is no gravity which effects the weight of people and items.
STDT 4365,"  Since weight is the force of gravity on an object, the weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. In this case, the moon has low gravity, so the weight decreases. "
STDT 4366, because in space you are weightless so you weigh in kilograms becasue the moon has less mass  
STDT 4368,"earths mass is much bigger than the moons, therefore the moons gravitational force is less than in the earth."
STDT 4373," So basically you would weigh less on the moon because,there is less gravity and the more gravity you get the more you weigh for example, like on earth we have a lot of gravity which keeps us on the ground and since there is more gravity on the earth you would weigh more than if you were on the moon. "
STDT 4375," It is different because the mass of the moon is smaller than the earth, therefore there is less gravitational force on the moon. That means the astronaut's weight will be less on the moon than on earth. "
STDT 4384," Because there is no gravity in space, therefore their weight would not come to the surface. "
STDT 4385, The astronaut's weight would be heavier on Earth because Earth has a greater mass than the moon. The moon has a smaller mass than the Earth so the weight will decrease as well. But the mass of the astronaut will stay the same. 
STDT 4394," There is less gravity on the moon than on the Earth, which means the astronaut has less weight. There is more gravity on Earth, which would make the astronaut's weight greater than on the moon. "
STDT 4413,On earth his body mass is heavy and weighs him down
STDT 4414,An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because there's less gravity on the moon than Earth.  
STDT 4418, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than the Earth because the moon has less gravity than Earth which decreases the astronaut's weight. 
STDT 4421," Weight all depends on gravity. Since the gravity on the moon is way less then on earth, the weight would be less then on the earth. "
STDT 4424, It's because since we are away from gravity in space there is no gravity but in earth there is so when we go up in space our weight changes since we have no gravity. 
STDT 4436," An  astronaut's weight is different on the moon because it has less mass and also because it is really tiny. The moon also has less gravity. If we lived on a planet bigger than earth, we would be heavier, but if we lived on the moon, we would be lighter.  "
STDT 4441,"     Weight depends on mass and gravity, when an astronaut is on Earth, his mass would not change wether he is on the moon or on Earth, but his weight would be more on Earth than on the moon because the Earth has greater gravitational pull than the moon. Therefore, the astronaut would weigh more on Earth than on the moon. "
STDT 4444,An astronaut weight is different on the moon than earth because on earth gravity brings you down and on the moon its not that much.  
STDT 4445," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the gravitational force is different. Earth has a greater gravitational force, so the astronaut's weight will be greater than on the moon, where the gravitational force is less. "
STDT 4446," Objects on the Moon weigh less than they do on the Earth because there is a lot less gravity on the moon than on earth. The astronauts are able to jump higher and leap because they "" weigh"" less.  Weight is defined by the gravitational pull an object has based on mass.  Because when there is less gravity on the moon, the astronaut weighs less.  "
STDT 4448," since weight is the force of gravity on an object, the weight of the astronaut increases in a location with high amounts of gravity, and the opposite happens when they are in a location with low amounts of gravity. so since there's less gravity on the moon, the astronauts weight differs compared to earth, the astronaut would weigh less since there is less gravity on the moon than on earth, but their mass stays the same. "
STDT 4456,The gravity is different on earth than the moon. So less gravity on the moon than on earth.
STDT 4457,"  Weight depends on mass and gravity. The moon has less gravity than the earth, so the astronaut weighs differient.   "
STDT 4458, The moon has less mass than the earth that's why you weigh less on the moon. When the less mass that means less gravity. 
STDT 4459, since weight is a force of gravity a persons weight changes depending on the gravity of the planet. earth has more gravity then the moon does so when a person is on the moon their weight decreases.
STDT 4461, An astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because weight requires mass and gravity so it may change depending on location and the moon's gravity is less than ours. 
STDT 4462, An astronauts weight is different because there is zero gravity in space they are unable to control where they go in space  order to stay still they have to wear magnetic shoes. Earth is different because it has gravity and you can move wherever you want and don't have to wear no magnet shoes. 
STDT 4466," Weight is a measure of force, On Earth people are weight in pounds (lb) or newtons (N). Since weight is the force of gravity on an object, the weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. So astronaut's weigh less on the moon but their mass stays the same "
STDT 4468," Much less gravity on the moon than on earth, so you weigh less. "
STDT 4470,"Our weight on moon is less than it would be on Earth due to a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon. The moon's gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon. ... This means that if you went to the moon you would weigh less, even though your mass stays the same."
STDT 4473,The moon has less gravity than earth so a person would weigh less on the moon. 
STDT 4476, Because weight depends upon gravity and mass but gravity on earth differs from gravity on moon. 
STDT 4483, because there is no gravity so it will leave them weightless  
STDT 4485," Because the Moon is smaller than the earth, it has a weaker gravitational pull.  Our weight on the Moon is less than it would be on Earth due to the strength of gravity on the Moon.  The Moon's gravitational force is determined by mass and the size of the moon, so if you went to the Moon, you would weigh less even though your mass would stay the same."
STDT 4503, There's less gravity on the moon and other planets than earth.  
STDT 4524,because the moon has less gravitational pull.
STDT 4526, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because the moon has less gravity than the Earth.  
STDT 4527, The weight of the astronaut changened because amount of gravity is decraesing. 
STDT 4530," An astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because, the moon is smaller than earth and has weaker gravitational pull."
STDT 4535, the earth is bigger/larger than the moon so it has less gravitational pull. 
STDT 4543," simply because there is less gravity on the moon then on the earth, therefore, making us lighter."
STDT 4552, Our weight on moon is less than it would be on Earth due to a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon. 
STDT 4596," The reason for the change in weight is because, of the gravitational pull that earth has on you. For instance, the further away you are from earth, the weaker the pull is going to be.  "
STDT 4605, In earth its 100kg and in the moon 162.2N  
STDT 4607," Weight is the force of gravity on an object, the weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. "
STDT 4608, It depends how much mass the astronot has in space 
STDT 4627, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth is because. On the moon there is less gravity than on the moon so your weight will lessen so you with start to almost float because the less gravity the less time it takes to come down . 
STDT 4629, because there is less gravity on the moon then the earth 
STDT 4630, The weight on an  astronaut is different  on the moon than on earth because the force  of gravity changes  and the weight depend of  mass and gravity  and changes depending on the place  . 
STDT 4631, An astronauts weight is different on the moon because the gravitational force is weaker 
STDT 4650," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the earth  because, the earth has more gravitational pull than the moon does. "
STDT 4651," Things that are on earth have mass. This mass is measured in kilograms. Weight is measured in newtons, or pounds in simple form. Weight is a gravitational force acting upon objects due to gravity. Meanwhile, mass is the amount of matter in a specific object. Weight changes depending on location because it depends on mass and gravity. Since weight can change depending on location, in space, you weight less than you do on earth. "
STDT 4653, The strength of gravity. The astronaut only has 1/6 of his body weight on the moon but he has the same mass as he did on earth. Everything in space has hardly any weight to it.  
STDT 4655," An astronauts weight changes on the moon because there is less gravity in outer space than here on earth, however the mass will stay the same."
STDT 1643, a asrtronaunts weight differs bc on earth we have gravity unlike on the moo n or in space theirs no gravity to hold the people down 
STDT 4666," On the moon, astronaut's have a smaller weight. That is because weight depends on gravity and the moon has less gravity than Earth does."
STDT 4677, due to a difference of gravity if u went to the moon u would weigh less and on earth u would weight more due to gravity  
STDT 4678, His weight is different on the moon than on Earth because the gravitational force on the moon is weaker than the Earth's. 
STDT 4691, The astronauts weight would be less on the moon than it is on the earth. The gravitational force is smaller on the moon because the moon is smaller than the earth. You would weigh more on earth.  
STDT 4694," An astronauts weight is different on the moon than on earth because the moon has less powerful gravity than the  earth, and it is gravity that causes weight. "
STDT 4695, The weight of the astronaut is different because of the gravitational force in space. It is because the two objects are drawn because of one another and the force that pushes against them. 
STDT 4697," Because there is no gravity on the moon pulling them down, their weight changes.  The pull of gravity is the other half of your mass in calculating weight.  "
STDT 4700, The gravity on the moon is different from what it is on earth so are mass will be the same but are weight will be different we will wight less than wight on earth so if I were on the earth and wight 120 pounds I would wight 20 pounds on the moon that's six time less than what i wight on earth  
STDT 4703, you are smaller. 
STDT 4705, On Earth you weigh more than on the moon because there is more gravity on Earth than there is on the moon. 
STDT 4706, The plant that haves more mass than the earth will pull you 
STDT 4710, its because of gravity 
STDT 4711," When you are in space you weigh less because there is no gravity. Say you are 175 pounds, you will weigh 79 kg. Because there is not gravity.  "
STDT 4713, The mass on the moon and earth are the same but the gravitational force are different so less weight.
STDT 4714," Because of the lack of gravity. Without gravity, you cannot have weight to be pulled down. "
STDT 4717,"The weight's different because weight increase with more gravity and decreases with less, since the earth has more gravity than the moon, the weight has changed. "
STDT 4720,An astronauts weight is different on the moon because since the moon has no gravitational force it changes the weight  
STDT 4721," If the astronaut weighed 160 pounds, then he would weigh 14 pounds on the moon. An object with weight needs to have mass and gravity because it is a measure of force. "
STDT 4735," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the Earth because there is less gravity, causing the astronaut to weigh less on the moon than on Earth.      "
STDT 4737, The moon has less gravitational pull than earth. Becaus earth is big enough to have a great gravitational force on every thing that is on earth And the moon being Smaller means that the moons  gravity is not going to be strong like earths. 
STDT 4741, The gravitational pull is different on earth then it is on the moon.  
STDT 983, the moons gravity is less than Earths So an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on Earth but his or her mass remains the same 
STDT 4745, The reason why an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it Is on Earth is because there is more gravity earth than on the moon so that Is why an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth. 
STDT 4764, At the time the astronauts first land the moon their weight was less. This is because the moon has less mass than the Earth so that means less gravity. Weight is determined by gravity.  The greater the gravity the greater the weight of mass.  Since the mooon has less gravity their weight would be less than it would be on the earth. 
STDT 4768, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because there is less gravity on the moon then there is on earth so the astronaut's weight decreases but the astronaut's mass stays the same. 
STDT 4787, An astronauts weight is different on the moon than on earth because the gravity is less there. Weight increases with more gravity so the person will weigh more on earth even though their mass stays the same. 
STDT 4931,"On earth there is a stronger force of gravity. So, the weight of the human is more than     the weight of the human on the moon.      "
STDT 4933," It's because gravity on the moon is 1/6 the gravity on earth, so you will weigh six times less  the normal   "
STDT 4942," On the moon there is very little gravitational attraction and on earth there is quite a bit of gravitational attraction, which means everything will be a bit heavier on earth.   "
STDT 4943, The gravitational force is less on the moon. Thus you weigh less on the moon than on Earth.   
STDT 4946," Astronauts' weights are different from being on the moon and earth because the normal weight on earth would normally be 100 pounds or 200 but on the moon, you will weigh 33 pounds. or higher. It depends on how much you weigh but the reason why your weight would be lower would be because of gravity.      "
STDT 4947,      An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because there is less mass and gravity on the moon. 
STDT 4948, because the gravitational strength is a lot less then earth. 
STDT 4950," Astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the moon has less of a gravitational pull than earth, so you would weigh less. "
STDT 4958, It's different on the moon because it no gravity up there.   
STDT 4959, theres less gravity on the moon then there is on the earth 
STDT 4960," In space there is no gravity, because there is no ground or normal force.  The astronauts are technically weightless in space. "
STDT 4961, The gravity is way more on earth than on the moon that is why. 
STDT 4966," Because on the moon there is less gravity than on earth, so on the moon you are lighter, but on earth you are heavier because the gravity is stronger on earth than on the moon, making the astronaut's lighter on the moon than on earth. "
STDT 4967, It is different because the gravity strength is lesser than the gravity on earth. 
STDT 4968," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon has less mass and gravity. When the force of gravity is less, it will cause people and things weigh less. "
STDT 4970, Our weight on the moon is lighter then on Earth because of a different  strength of gravity on the moon  
STDT 4971, it changes on the moon 
STDT 4974," The astronaut's mass on earth and on the moon are the same. The gravity on the moon is less than the earth, so an astronaut would weigh less on the moon. "
STDT 4976," Since the moon is smaller than the earth, it has a weaker gravitational pull. "
STDT 4977, The astronauts weight on earth is really just decided by the mass of the planet so they would be quite heavy but on the moon he or she wouldn't be that heavy because of the moons mass. 
STDT 4984, An astronaut's weight would be different on the Moon than on Earth because the gravitational force on the Earth is stronger than the gravitational force on the Moon. 
STDT 4986, Because of newton the metric measurement of force mass refers to amount of matter in an object.  
STDT 4987, The earth is larger than the moon which means it has a bigger gravitational pull. This is why I weigh more on the Earth and weigh less on the moon because the moon has less mass than the earth.  
STDT 4988," I think it's because the moon has a different gravity, so he has the same weight, but the gravity on the moon is less, so it allows him to jump higher and do things we can't do on earth, because earth has more gravity. "
STDT 4995, I think the astronauts' weight  would be a lot lighter than when its on earth because the moon is a lot lighter than the earth. 
STDT 4998, Because the gravitational attraction is different on the moon is much less than it is here on earth and a person weighs less on the moon than on earth. 
STDT 4999," Astronauts' weights are different on the moon than on earth because of gravity. The weight depends on gravity, so when there's less gravity, The weight will decrease and when there's more gravity, the weight will increase. And because there is less gravity on the moon than on the Earth, the Autronaut weights more on Earth than on the moon.  "
STDT 5000,   The gravitational attraction on the Moon is much less than it is here on Earth. 
STDT 5004," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because there is no gravity. On Earth, however, there is gravity. "
STDT 5008," Weight is the force experienced by an object because of gravity, and the earth has more gravitational force than the moon, so an astronaut would way less on the moon, than you would on the earth.  "
STDT 5010, Your weight depends on the force on an object due to its mass and gravity. 
STDT 5011, It will change because it's farther away then earth. If its more farther away from the sun it will have less gravity. 
STDT 5012," The weight on earth is more than on the moon due to gravity. The moon's gravity pulls down to the center of the earth, so you are pulled to the ground, making your weight more than on the moon because the moon's gravity is weaker. "
STDT 5014, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon has less mass than the earth and therefore less gravitational force.   
STDT 5017," Astronauts' weights are different on the moon than they are on the Earth, because there is no gravity in space.  "
STDT 5023," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because it's a measurement of force. And since it's a measure of force depending on how much gravity there is, it depends on how much it weighs. As an example, the more gravity, like on earth, the more you weigh and, since gravity is pushing you down to the center, you become heavier, meaning you'll weigh more. "
STDT 5026," On Earth you are heavier, so the astronaut would be heavier,while being on the moon would make him lighter. "
STDT 5028, Earth has more gravity so pulls you down where on the moon you float 
STDT 5032," Weight changes depending on the location, because it depends on everything else that has mass and gravity. Therefore, if you were on the moon, you would weigh less than on Earth because the moon has a weaker gravitational pull. "
STDT 5033, GRAVITY 
STDT 5034, An astront's weight is different on the moon because of the gravitational pull on the moon. 
STDT 5037," Well, not only because of its gravity.. It has different amounts of Newtons. "
STDT 5044, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth due to the fact that the gravitational pull from Earth is decreased. 
STDT 5047," The moon is smaller than the earth, so the gravitational force is weaker than on earth. This causes the astronaut's weight to go down when they are on the moon. Their mass does not change on the moon. Mass stays the same wherever you are.    "
STDT 5051," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because the moon has less mass than the earth. The moon can not pull objects towards itself like the earth can because the earth is stronger. If you go to the  moon  you will weigh less, but your mass will stay the same. "
STDT 5052," An astronauts weight is different on the earth than it is on the moon. Because there is more mass on the earth than the moon. And when there is more gravity there is more weight. When there is less gravity you don't weigh as much. So on the moon there is less gravity so an astronaut doesn't weigh as much.On the the earth there is gravity so the astronaut weighs more, but there mass is still the same on the moon and on the earth.So there mass changes no matter there is gravity or no gravity. "
STDT 5054, Weight is different on the moon because weight is a measure of force.  It requiars gravity and mass. 
STDT 5058," It is different, because there is less gravity on the moon than on earth. So the weight is less, because weight is the force experienced by an object due to gravity. "
STDT 5061, the  earth moon  has considerably  less mass than less the earth  itself 
STDT 5062," Due to the gravity on the moon is different to the gravity on earth, the astronauts' weight will decrease.  "
STDT 5064," An astronaut's weight is lighter on the moon because the moon is smaller than the earth. The smaller the object and the less the weight it is, the less gravitation pull it has.  "
STDT 5065," The weight will decrease because the moon has less mass than Earth, so the gravitational pull will be weaker. "
STDT 5068, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because gravity's pull is stronger on Earth than on the moon.  
STDT 5074, there is less mass 
STDT 5077, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the amount of gravitational force is smaller or greater than it is on earth. 
STDT 5078, Because there is less gravity force pulling them. 
STDT 5081, it have no gravity on the moon 
STDT 5084," Earth is the perfect size of a planet for mankind. The gravitational pull is not to light to float of to space, but also not to heavy to be crushed under its weight. However, the gravitational pull on the moon while being great, is still lighter than earth's. There is less gravity holding you down making your weight lighter as well. Being less heavy in weight on the moon can make thing that are very heavy, very light. It would be like a hand holding down an object, it's going to be hard to pick it up. but if the hand releases the object, is going to be easy. "
STDT 5094," In space, the weight of an astronaut is different because the gravity in space is different from the gravity on Earth.    "
STDT 5095, It is different because on the moon there is less gravity. 
STDT 5099, This is because the moon has less gravity than Earth and the weight of something or someone will lessen in an area with less gravity. 
STDT 5102, Their weight changed because the moon is smaller and has a weaker gravitational pull. 
STDT 5103, the moons gravitational pull is less than that of earth 
STDT 5104, The moon has less gravity than the earth has. 
STDT 5106," An astronauts weight would lower, Since there is less gravity on the moon then there is on earth. "
STDT 5112, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because it has a weaker gravitational pull than on earth.  
STDT 5113," I say that astronauts don't have the same weight as they do on earth and the moon. In space there is zero gravity, so they would be able to feel less weight and also that they will be able to jump higher. "
STDT 5116, A astronaut's weight is different on the moon because on the moon their is less gravity and less mass so the astronaut's weight will decrease but your actual will not change. 
STDT 5126," The Earth is larger than the Moon, so it will have less gravity than the Earth, which will make the astronaut weigh less. "
STDT 5127," The moon has less of a gravitational pull than on earth, so the weight of an astronaut would decrease. "
STDT 5130, The astronaut weight would decrease because there is no gravity on the moon and there is gravity on earth that is holding us down and making sure that we don't float away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
STDT 5133, on earth gravity is a thing and on the moon you are weightless 
STDT 5135," On earth, there is a strong gravitational pull. On the moon, the gravitational pull is not as strong "
STDT 5140," The less gravity there is, the less you weigh. The more gravity there is, the more you weigh. But your mass always stays the same, since the moon has less gravity than Earth, you would weigh less. But your mass will stay the same. "
STDT 5144," Earth has more gravity than the moon, for example. You hold a hammer and your about to drop it on the floor. It will go faster, because the earth has more gravity. But on the other hand, if you were on the moon, the hammer would go much slower because the moon has less gravity. And you might be asking how this is related to the astronaut. Well, the astronaut on earth has more weight  than the other astronaut on the moon. It is like the same thing.  "
STDT 5154," Weight depends on both mass and gravity.  In space there is no gravity, therefore the mass of an object stays the same but the weight is lighter. "
STDT 5155, Because the gravitational force is different.  
STDT 5161, Because the moon has less weight and the Earth has more weight. 
STDT 5163, an astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth bc the gravitational pull on the moon is less than the gravitational pull on earth so objects on the moon seem a lot lighter  
STDT 5166, Astronaut's weight is different on the Moon because the Moon has less gravity than Earth. Another thing Astronaut's weight is different on the Moon is weight is force of gravity so that why Astronauts weight is less on Moon than Earth. 
STDT 5167, Less gravity on the moon. 
STDT 5170, because the earth has gravity  and the moon don't so your feet aren't as firm on the ground because gravity isn't  pulling as much of you down. 
STDT 5172, on some planets you would be ligheter and on others you would be heaver 
STDT 5176," Astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because in space and on other planets there is different pulls of gravity, so in space your body gets lighter.  That is why you can float around in space and float into the void. "
STDT 5180, The astronaut's weight  changes on the moon because he floats due to lack of gravity. This means he is lighter on the moon than on earth. 
STDT 5183," There is less gravity, thus less weight.   "
STDT 5184, Astronauts' weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because of newtons. An astronaut's weight is heavier in pounds when they are closer to earth due to gravity. 
STDT 5190," If you are on a planet that has a larger mass than earth, you would weigh more because that planet has a greater force of gravity.  "
STDT 5192," The moon is smaller and the moon has less gravity, which makes the astronaut weight more on Earth and less on the Moon.  "
STDT 5194," The weight of the astronaut increases in a place with more gravity and the astronaut's weight decreases in a place with less gravity. Because the moon's gravity is less than the earth's, the astronaut's weight is less but the mass is the same. "
STDT 351," because the moon's mass is less than Earth's mass,because the moon's mass is smaller then Earths mass gravity will pull on you less. "
STDT 5205, The weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. So the moon's gravity is less than Earth's. That's why an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth. 
STDT 5212,"   Since the moon has significantly less mass than the Earth, it will not pull objects toward itself at the strength that Earth will . "
STDT 5223, The weight of the astronaut will be greater on earth because there is more gravity. It will be less in space since there is less gravity. 
STDT 5225, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because gravity is different on the earth and moon. 
STDT 1774," because the moon doesn't have gravity and the earth does,and because the gravity on the earth makes you heavier than on the moon, because the moon doesn't have gravity. "
STDT 5230, An astronaut's weight would change because the gravity on the moon is less than the Earth's gravitational pull. But mass will stay the same regardless if a person is on the moon in a rocket or on earth. 
STDT 5231," On the moon, you would weigh 5 times less than your normal weight because there's less gravity. "
STDT 5232," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon has less mass than Earth, therefore less gravitational pull. "
STDT 5233," Because there is more gravity on earth than there is on the moon, the more gravity, weight increases, the less gravity, and weight decreases. "
STDT 5235, The astronaut would lose a lot of weight but he would't lose any mass. 
STDT 5239," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because the gravitational pull on the moon is less than an Earth, making them able to jump higher, and generally making them weigh less. On Earth, however, there is more gravity, pulling individuals towards the Earth's core, making them be pulled down quickly if they jump up. "
STDT 5243," it's different because there is no gravity on the moon, so their weight is gonna be less. "
STDT 2456," Because on earth people live all around the world and it takes up mass and weight, so the astronaut on earth weights more. While the astronaut on the moon weights less because there's no mass or space being taken up on the moon. "
STDT 5246, becase if you were 175 lbs on earth and 29 lbs on the moon its becase theres less N 
STDT 5248, the gravity on the moon is way less than on earth 
STDT 5252, Because the gravitational field strength is much less. 
STDT 5256," Weight changes depending on the amount of gravitational force that is present in a particular location, and the moon has less gravity than Earth. Therefore, an astronaut may weigh less on the moon than they did on their home planet due to less gravitational force. "
STDT 5260, There's less gravitational pull on the moon than on the earth.  
STDT 5262, Earth has a stronger gravitational pull than the moon's. Mass and gravity change depending on the location. They would weigh more on earth than the moon because of gravity. 
STDT 5266," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because of gravity, gravity on the moon is different from gravity on earth because of the atmosphere, causing the astronaut's weight to lighten on the moon.   "
STDT 5267," Well, the astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because gravity does not take place in space on the moon, so your weight will increase. "
STDT 5271, because the moon has 1/6th of the gravity more then earth 
STDT 5273," On the moon, people or objects weigh less because the gravitational field strength is much less. "
STDT 5276, Just different because there's different gravitational pulls towards the Moon and then Earth that's why they can jump really high on the moon and it's just normal on Earth 
STDT 5280," The moon has less mass than the earth, so therefore, it will have a smaller pull on the astronaut, and vice versa. To put it in magnetical terms, two magnets attract each other more if they are closer to each other rather than far from each other. "
STDT 5281, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because  There is no gravity on the moon so he less weight  
STDT 5283," The earth's mass is stronger and bigger, therefore the astronaut's weight is different. "
STDT 5291," Because on the moon, there is a massive decrease in gravity, and in the vacuum of space there is no gravity at all. So if you were to jump on the moon, you'd jump a lot higher depending on the gravity and weight.  "
STDT 5300," The moon has less gravity than the Earth.  The weight of the astronaut is measured by force.  Both mass and weight are needed.  The weight is less on the moon however, the mass stays the same.   "
STDT 5304, because the moon doesn't pull very much as the earth 
STDT 5311," The moon is smaller than the Earth, meaning it has less gravity. "
STDT 5312," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon has less gravity than the Earth, so you can jump on Earth and go straight back down.The more gravity the more you weigh, the less gravity the less you weigh. "
STDT 5313, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon's gravity is less than earth's. So the astronaut will weigh less on the moon than on earth. 
STDT 5367, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because there is no gravity on th moon and there is gravity on earth.  
STDT 5369," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than the moon than it is on earth because the ,moons mass is a lot less than earths mass. It was also scientifically proven that the moon i smaller than the earth. Therefore the gravitational attraction on the moon is less than it is on earth, since the gravotational sttraction is less than it is on earth we don't float around like austronauts due to the lack of gravity on the moon/in space its self.  "
STDT 5381, The astronaut would weigh less on the moon because the moon's gravity is less than the earths. 
STDT 5384, The weight on the moon is less because you are farther away from earth which means there is a less gravitational pull when you are on the moon. 
STDT 5388," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because it has less gravitational pull on the moon than it does on Earth, making the astronaut lighter. "
STDT 5390, because there  is no gravity in space. 
STDT 5393," Our weight  on  moon  is less  than  it would be on  Earth  due to a difference  of  the strength  of  gravity on the  moon . The  moon's  gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size  of  the  moon . ... This means that if you went to the  moon  you would  weigh  less, even though  your  mass stays the same! "
STDT 5394," The weight on earth is based on gravity, so if the astronaut was on the moon, he would way less because the moon has less gravity than earth does, and if he was in space they would not weigh anything. The astronaut would still have the same mass though on the moon and in space as they did on earth "
STDT 5400, There is less gravitational force on the moon than on the earth.  
STDT 5402, because on the moon there is 0 gravity  
STDT 3885," The amount of gravity on the moon is less than on earth so, the astronaut weighs less on the moon than on earth.  "
STDT 4804, Because gravity is very different from earth!  Everything is alot lighter! Astronauts would float and feel very light because they arent used too little to none gravity. 
STDT 5413, Earth has more gravity than the moon because earth is bigger than the moon. Since weight depends on both mass and gravity that mean's astronauts weight less on the moon.  
STDT 5414, The moon's gravity is less than the Earth's. 
STDT 5428, Their weight changed but not their mass. Weight is a measure of force. It needs an object to have mass and gravity. 
STDT 5431, The moon is smaller than the earth so that mean that you'll have a smaller amount of weight than when you are earth because that earth has a larger amount of earth. 
STDT 5433, because the earth is way bigger and has more mass than the moon.  
STDT 5436, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the gravitational pull on the moon is way less than on earth. 
STDT 5438,    He weighs more on earth because the force of gravity on the moon is less than the gravity on earth.   
STDT 5444, It is different because there is less gravity on the moon than earth.  
STDT 5448, Because there is no gravitational force on the moon. No gravity. The earth is big and has mass which has a lot of gravitational force and pull the astronaut down on earth. 
STDT 5453, Our weight on the moon is less than it is on earth because a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon because the moons' gravity force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon which is 1/6th of the size of the earth as a result we would weigh less on the moon.  
STDT 5456, There is less gravity and mass on the moon then earth 
STDT 5457, Earth is bigger then the moon and the doesn't have a lot of mass so the moon is weaker and. 
STDT 5462, The gravitational force is affected by the distance  
STDT 5463," The astronaut's weight is different on earth because there's gravity, and no gravity in space so, there for the astronauts weight will not be the same.  "
STDT 5465, because the gravitational field strength is much less. 
STDT 5471, Astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the Moon has less mass then the Earth. 
STDT 5472, The weight on the moon would be less because there is less gravity and the weight would be more on earth because there is more gravity.  
STDT 5474," Due to the weight of the moon being less than earth it does not have as much of a gravitational pull, for example if earth were to be the size of the moon, it would feel the same as walking on the moon. Although people might have a different way of transportation. "
STDT 5480, The moon has less gravity then the Earth there for of the force the pull of the gravity on the moon is less and you also wheight less.  
STDT 5481," The gravitational field strength of the moon is 1.6 N/kg. So this means for each kilogram of mass, an object will experience the moons gravitational strength. So now we know how a astronaut will weigh differently. Astronaut's could also jump higher and leap farther than they could do on earth. "
STDT 5485, n 
STDT 5493, The weight of an astronaut is different on the moon than it is on earth because the gravitational pull is weaker on the moon.  
STDT 5497, on earth the gravity is stronger which means that he is more held to the ground but on other planets it is weaker which means he is not held to the ground as much. 
STDT 5499,"  An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon has a weaker gravitational force,  so your weight will be less on the moon than on earth.   "
STDT 683, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the gravity of the moon is different than the Earth's gravity. 
STDT 5514, The moon has less gravity than the earth. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than on earth but his or hers mass remains the same.  
STDT 5516, There is more gravity on Earth than on the the Moon therefore the astronaut would weigh less. 
STDT 5517, It's because weight is a measure of force it requires an object to have mass an gravity   
STDT 5519, Cause the gravity is different on both. 
STDT 5521, Because on the moon the gravitational force isn't as strong as the gravitational force on earth. 
STDT 5522," If an astronaut is on the moon, there is less mass on the moon, so the force of attraction is less than here on earth.  "
STDT 5535, when you are on earth you way more. When you are on the moon you way less. That is because when you are on the moon you using more gravity then when you are on the earth. 
STDT 5536, It isn't different all that is happening is they are floating. 
STDT 5537, because of the difference between the gravitational pull. 
STDT 5538, An astronaut's weight on the moon and on Earth is different because the moon does not have a lot of gravity therefore they will not weigh as much as they would on Earth because Earth has lots and lots of gravity. 
STDT 5541," Because weight is the force of gravity on an object, in the moon the weight of an object would decrease, because the weight on an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less gravity, and the moon does not have much gravity, while the earth has more gravity tan the moon. "
STDT 5543," The reason why an astronaut's weight on the moon if different from it is on planet Earth is because of one simple reason, there isn't as much gravity on the moon holding things down. "
STDT 5548, thare are no gravity in space while on the there is an atmosphere giving us gravity without that atmosphere there would be no gravity gravity on earth and no one wood be able to breathe but there is no atmosphere on planet earth giving us what we need to have gravity unlike out in space by the moon they do not have a atmosphere giving them no  gravity. 
STDT 5549," When an astronaut goes to the moon, their weight changes and when they go to earth their weight changes back to normal. Their weight is measured in kilograms. The amount of weight an object has affects the amount of force the object has, but its mass does not change. Mass is the amount of matter an object is, so when an astronaut goes to the moon, the moon is smaller than the earth and has less force to pull objects into it, that's why the weight is different on the moon.  "
STDT 5550," The gravitational pull on the moon is not as strong because the moon is much smaller than Earth.  Earth is much larger, so the gravitational pull is alot stronger. "
STDT 5551, weight is the force of gravity on a object  
STDT 5552, an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because there is less gravity. 
STDT 5554," Because weight is the gravitational force acting on an object, its weight increases in places with more gravity and decreases in places with less. The moon, for example, has a lower gravity than Earth. So, while an astronaut on the moon weighs less than on Earth, his or her mass remains the same. "
STDT 5558, I think it is because of the gravity because earth has gravity and the moon does not 
STDT 5560, because there isno gravity in space but theres gravity in space. 
STDT 5564," Let's say you weigh 100 pounds on Earth. If you go to the moon you will weigh, let's say you weigh 30 pounds, maybe even less. The reason for this is because of the mass of the moon. On Earth, you weigh 100 pounds. That is how hard the Earth pulls down on you. This is because gravity is two things with mass attracted to each other. That is why the moon stays in the orbit of Earth, and you have mass, so you are attracted to the Earth. So now you are on the moon, you can jump really high because the moon is a lot tinier than the Earth, so its gravity is not as strong. "
STDT 5566, if i was a astronaut and i was traveling to another planet with a much larger mass than earth my weight would be affected because if you were on earth and you weight like 154 pounds on the mood you would weight like no pounds because of the mass of the planets   
STDT 5568, Due to the gravity on Earth compared to the gravity on the and the mass of the object the weight is different because there is less gravity on the moon than on earth. 
STDT 5570," An astronauts weight will change on the moon because his or her weight will decrease but his or her mass will stay the same, Why? Because there is barley any gravitity on the moon than there is on earth. Your weight will be different depending where your at.  "
STDT 5576, The moon has less of a mass than the Earth thar for an astronaut would weigh less on the moon than on the Earth. 
STDT 5578,  Astronauts' weight is different on the moon than it is on the earth because the moon's mass doesn't have as much mass as the earth.  
STDT 5581," On earth, your weight is always greater than on the moon. This is because the moon has a less gravitational pull on an object than Earth. "
STDT 5582, Because  the moon has no gravity and the earth has a bigger mass than the moon. 
STDT 5585, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because there is not as much gravity on the moon as there is on Earth.  
STDT 5588, Because the gravity on the moon is weaker than the earths. 
STDT 5593, why an astronauts weight is different  on the moon then earth is  the gravitational force  
STDT 5602, gravity 
STDT 5604, because ther is low gravity on the moon 
STDT 5606, The astronaut's weight on the moon is a lot less than on the Earth because the moon is a lot smaller than the Earth so that causes the gravitational pull to not be that strong. 
STDT 5608," Because the gravity is different between the moon and Earth Because the gravitational force on earth is bigger Because the mass of the Earth is 6,371,000 miles compared to the moon which is 2,159.2 miles which is 27% of the earths mass and such so that the moon's gravity is 1/6 the amount of gravity on Earth  bc the moon is only 60% as dense of the moon. "
STDT 5609, Because the gravity on the moon is wanting two bring you up makes you weigh less.   
STDT 5610, Their weight is different because the gravity on the earth y=is strong than the moon   
STDT 5611, Because the moon has less mass than planet Earth so it has less gravitational force. 
STDT 5616, On earth its weighed by pounds on the moon it weighed by newton. 
STDT 5617, It is difference because in the outer space their is no gravity. on the earth there is a gravity that pulls you down. their is a big difference because in outer space you float and u can die in the outer space because of no trees that can produce oxygen. on earth there are trees that create oxygen. 
STDT 5618, due to gravity it keeps us down  the moons gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of there moon 
STDT 5626," The moon has less mass than, so it has less gravity, as a result, the astronaut weighs less. "
STDT 5628, because the moon is smaller. 
STDT 792," The Moon has less mass than the Earth, because the Moon is tinier than the Earth. That's because only about the moon is 60 percent as dense as earth. Which is why the moon's gravitational attraction is less than earth's gravitational attraction, so a person weighs less on the moon. "
STDT 5631," The astronaut's mass won't change, but his/her weight will. The moon is smaller than the earth and has a weaker gravitational pull and makes you weigh less. :)   "
STDT 5632," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on the Earth due to the mass of the moon. Since the moon has less mass than Earth, the gravitational force between the astronaut and the moon will be less. This will make the astronaut weigh less on the moon than on Earth. "
STDT 5633, The astronauts weigh less on the moon than on earth because there is less gravity to add with the mass of the astronauts. 
STDT 5639, The gravitational force on the moon is weaker than the gravitational force on earth. 
STDT 5642, The moon is smaller than the earth. The mass and gravity are also different on the moon.  
STDT 5643, The reason why and astronaught's weight is lighter on the moon then it is than Earth is because the moon have less gravity so it make u feel lighter but back on Earth it has more gravity so u will feel heavier. 
STDT 5646,    An astronaut's weight is different because of the force between the person and the moon. 
STDT 5649, the weight is different from the moon because of the moon has less mass than the earth itself. 
STDT 5650, Because This Is No Gravity In Space Only Earth 
STDT 5653," The reason an astronaut's weight changes in  different locations is because the weight of an object will increase in a different location with more gravity and will decrease in a place with less gravity, because weight is the force of gravity of an object. "
STDT 5655," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the force of gravity is different on the moon compared to the Earth. On Earth, the astronaut can weigh 175 pounds. However, on the moon, the astronaut can weigh 29 pounds because there is less gravity than on earth. "
STDT 5660," The weight of an astronaut is different on the moon than on Earth because of gravity. There is more gravity on Earth than on the moon, so the weight of the astronaut is greater on Earth than on the moon. "
STDT 5665," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon is smaller than Earth which means that the gravitational force of the Earth is stronger than the moon. So, his weight will seem less than what it is on Earth, even though his mass didn't change. "
STDT 5668, It has a less gravitational pull because it has a larger distance from the gravitational force. Because it has a farther distance from earth. 
STDT 5669, The astronaut will weigh the same as a feather because the moon has no gravitational pull.   
STDT 5671," Since the moon is smaller then earth,it has a weaker gravitational pull and also the moon only has 1/6 the gravity that earth does this means you weigh six time less then on the moon then you do on earth. "
STDT 5672, on earth gravitational force pushes your weight down and so you will weight more on earth than on the moon    
STDT 5675, Earth has more gravity then the moon so its a given that he is lighter. 
STDT 5676," On the moon, It will be less gravity than earth because of how much mass there is. if we were on earth we would be weighing more rather than weightless. "
STDT 5677," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because your weight changes due to the shift of gravity, moon has less gravity compared to earth, so you weigh less on the moon. "
STDT 5683," Astronauts' weights are different on the moon because weight needs mass and gravity, so when we leave the atmosphere it changes how much we weigh. "
STDT 5685, On Earth there is more gravity than on the moon.   
STDT 5688, The astronauts weight is different because weight relies on mass and gravity. 
STDT 5690, Our weight on the moon is less than it would be on earth because of a difference od the strength of gravity on the moon. The moos gravitational pull force is determined by the mass and the sizes of the moos. This is why we weight less on the moon while our mass stays the same.   
STDT 5691, An astronaut on the moon would weigh less because there is less gravitational force than if he was on earth. 
STDT 5692, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because  there's less gravity on the moon compared to the  gravity on Earth. So the astronauts would weigh less on the moon even though their mass stays the same.  
STDT 5695, Gravity. =] 
STDT 5696, astronauts weight is different on moon than it is to earth because of mass and the moon is smaller than the earth so theres less gravitational force on the moon than the earth. 
STDT 5009," Since the moon is smaller than the earth, it has a weaker gravitational force. In fact, 1/6 the gravity that earth does. you weight six times less on the moon than you do on earth. "
STDT 5701, There isn't any gravity on the moon pushing down on you making you lighter.  
STDT 5702," An astronaut's weight is different on the Moon than on Earth because of gravity, weight, and mass. Mass is measured in kilograms, while weight is measured by pounds. There is less gravity on the Moon than on Earth so an astronauts weight would be different on the Moon than on Earth. "
STDT 5703, The moon is smaller than earth so the gradational pull would be less. The astronaut  will have less pull from gravity on the moon so he will weigh less.      
STDT 5704,"  An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth, because Earth has a greater gravitational pull than the moon. "
STDT 5711," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it's on Earth's mass, which makes us weigh more than the moon. "
STDT 5713, An astronauts weight is different on the moon because the moon doesn't have gravity.  
STDT 5714, Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because when astronaut's are on the moon gravity is less on earth gravity 10x more. 
STDT 5718," It is because the mass of the moon is different than the earth, so you will weigh less than on the earth. "
STDT 5721," The moon has less gravity than earth that why when you're on the moon your as light as a feather and on earth you stay on the ground it's all because gravity, "
STDT 5726, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because there is not as much gravitational force because it is smaller.  This changes the mass making the gravitational force smaller. 
STDT 5731," An astronauts weight is affected By the amount of mass, but it's mass is lower on earth. "
STDT 5733, The gravity on the moon is less than on earth. 
STDT 5735, because on the moon you have less gravity. 
STDT 5736, the moon has less gravity than earth does. 
STDT 5738, because earth has more mass than the moon. 
STDT 5747, an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because there is less gravitational force is less on the moon 
STDT 5754," On Earth, we have more gravity than the moon and the less gravity means the less you weigh.  "
STDT 5756," The gravity is different on the moon, so it will affect the astronaut's weight. "
STDT 5760," The astronauts' weight on the moon is different than on earth because there is less gravity on the moon, which means the weight decreases, but on earth the gravity is more, so the weight is heavier. "
STDT 5765, It is different because the gravitational pull of the Earth is greater than the Moons. That means that an astronaut will weigh more on Earth than on the Moon.   
STDT 5767,   Your matter stays the same anywhere but your weight changes at different locations in the universe. Your weight changes because weight is the amount of gravitational force on your mass. 
STDT 5768, There is also a much smaller amount of gravity on the moon compared to the earth. Weight is a measure of gravity pulling mass toward the scale. So the person will weigh less as a number but have the same mass.   
STDT 5771, they weigh different because earth is 3x more weight than the  moon. 
STDT 5774, Because there is less gravity on the moon that's why your weight is not the same. 
STDT 5775," When the astronaut's weight is on earth, it will be much heavier on Earth when there's gravity, but if he is on the moon, the force of gravity decreases since the moon is farther away from Earth. If the astronaut jumped, it wouldn't be so hard on the moon, then if he was on earth. "
STDT 5777," In space, there is no Gravity but on earth we have gravity so that we don't start floating all around the earth. "
STDT 5780," When there is a smaller gravitational pull you will have a smaller weight so when you're in space you will have a smaller weight than what you havemon earth.m ,nk  "
STDT 5781," Earth has more mass than the moon. Since the moon has less mass, the force of attraction (gravity) is less, which causes a person to weigh less. "
STDT 5783," I get lighter when im in space because I only have mass not gravity or force, so I won't weigh as much as I did on earth. So on earth I might weigh 175 pounds but in space I'll weigh 29 pounds.  "
STDT 5784, The gravitational pull is different on the moon. There is less gravity on the moon so the astronaut weighs less than when they are on Earth.  
STDT 5786," The moon has less gravity than the Earth due to having less mass and greater distance from other planets. As a result, an astronaut's weight differs on the moon than on Earth. "
STDT 5791," The Weight of an Astronaut is different on the moon than the Earth because, the moon has less gravitational force on an object (Astronaut) than on Earth. "
STDT 5792, their weight increases. 
STDT 5793," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on the Earth because of gravity. On the moon there is no gravity, so the astronaut will weigh less.On the Earth there is gravity, so the astronaut will weigh more. "
STDT 5794," The reason why astronauts are lighter is because the moon is smaller than the earth and has less mass than the earth, which means the moon has a weaker gravitational pull than the earth. "
STDT 5800," Because the moon has less mass than the earth, it has less gravity. Therefore, the astronaut will have less gravity to weigh him or her down, making the astronaut weigh less. "
STDT 5803," The earth and the moon have different gravitational pulls.  The earth's weight is much more than the moon, therefore the earth's gravitational pull is stronger than the moon. "
STDT 5809," yes, because with more gravity on a object the weight of it increases. "
STDT 5812, On earth gravity isnt the same as it is on the moon. The astronaut will be lighter and he will float on the moon. 
STDT 5815, The moon has zero gravity and the astronaut would become weightless on the moon. 
STDT 5816, the moon is smaller so it has less gravity 
STDT 5818," When people go to outer space and through the exosphere, then their body has to get used to being up in space and it will make them feel very light, then when they come back down it is going to make them feel very heavy. "
STDT 5819, The gravitational pull on the moon is much less than earths gravitational pull and your weight changes depending on how much gravity there is somewhere so for an example your body weight in space is nothing because there is no gravity in space so there for your body will weight less on the moon.     
STDT 5821," The less mass an object/location has means it has less gravitational pull, which means you weigh less like the moon and earth. If the object/location has more mass it has more of a gravitational pull, which means you weigh more.   "
STDT 5822, this is because the moon has one sixth the gravity of earth 
STDT 5826, a  astronauts weight is different because  gravity is not as strong on the moon than earth so what means that the astronauts weight less   
STDT 5828, because there is less gravity on the moon so it causes them to weigh less... 
STDT 5829, The weight of your body decrease when your on the moon but the mass does not. 
STDT 5833," Yes, because the moon's mass is less than earth's mass, making the astronauts weigh less. "
STDT 5836, It's different because the weight is measure of an object to have both mass and gravity. 
STDT 5838," The reason it is different is because, as you get closer to the moon, the gravity decreases. "
STDT 5839, the weight would change from acceleration and weight on the moon is 1/6 times to weight on earth so we would weigh less on the moon than earth. 
STDT 5843," They require gravity, because there is not any gravity on the moon, you can't have an exact measurement in pounds of weight. "
STDT 5847, The astronauts' weight is changing in space because gravity is making you weigh  
STDT 5848," The moon has less gravity than the earth, therefore the astronaut's weight decreases.   "
STDT 5849, the weight changes in space. on earth can change but not by you floating in the air. but we do have gravity but we dont float. 
STDT 5854," There is less gravity on the moon then on the earth, so the astronaut would weigh less on the moon. "
STDT 5856," On the moon the gravity is less than it is on the earth. Astronauts have less body weight on the moon than the earth, so  they are heavy on earth. which means the moon has more gravity.   "
STDT 5860," It's because weight is a measure of force; it requires an object's mass and gravitational force. On Earth, your weight is measured in pounds and your mass is measured in kilograms. Your weight is different on the moon due to gravity. However, your mass is the same everywhere!   "
STDT 5861," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon has less gravity than the Earth. Earth has more gravity. The weight would be less on the moon, but their mass wouldn't change. "
STDT 5862," An astronaut's weight would be different on the moon compared to earth because a location with more gravity would mean a person or thing would weigh more. While on the moon there is less gravity than on earth, so someone's weight would be less than if they were on earth or another location with more gravity.  "
STDT 5864," An astronaut's weight is different in space because in space there is less gravity, meaning that you will weigh less. Unlike on earth, there is way more gravity,  making you much more.  "
STDT 5866, The weight differs because on the moon there is no gravity to hold the astronaut down therefore makes him lighter.  
STDT 5871, An astronaut weight is different on the moon then the earth because on earth gravity pulls you down and on the moon it's not as much. 
STDT 5873, On the moon the gravity is different because there is less gravity on the moon then on the earth      
STDT 5874, The reason why an astronaut's weight changes on the moon is because of the gravitational force. The gravitational force on the moon is less than on Earth because of the size difference. 
STDT 5956, An astronaut's weight is different than on the moon then it is on earth cause the less gravity maybe less the weight and pull on the moon. 
STDT 5965, I think an astronaut's weight is different on the moon because if you weight yourself on the moon you'll have a spacesuit which could and weight on to you.  
STDT 5966, Because the moon has less gravity than earth. 
STDT 5967, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because gravity relies on the mass of an object and the moon is much smaller than the earth so it would have less mass so the moon would have less of a gravitational pull. 
STDT 5970," An astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth is because the moon is smaller than Earth and more dense, meaning she would only weigh about one sixth as much as she did on Earth. Yes I said she because women are astronauts too. "
STDT 5975, Weight is affected by mass and gravity. The Earth has more gravity than the moon and that's why we weigh more on Earth than the moon. 
STDT 5979, because the gravitational field strength is much less 
STDT 5987,   The reason is because the gravitational force on the moon is less than it is on earth. 
STDT 4374,                     our weight on moon is less than it is on earth because of a difference of gravity on the moon. the moons gravity is determined the mass and size of the moon. 
STDT 5994, because on the moon there is almost no gravity  which means there wait isn't pulling them down 
STDT 5995, It is different because Earth has more gravity than the moon does. 
STDT 6001," The earth's gravity is more than the moon's gravity. Weight is the force of gravity on an object, so the weight of an object increases with more gravity and decreases with less gravity . The moon's gravity is less than earth's, therefore an astronaut weighs less on the moon. "
STDT 6003, The weight of an astronaut is different on the moon because the gravitational force is less than Earth. 
STDT 6004,  The weight on the moon is different because there is less gravity on the moon. The astronaut's mass stays the same in both places.    
STDT 6010, Weight depends on mass and gravity. This is why weight changes depending on the location. 
STDT 6011, Because there is gravity on earth and there is not as much on the moon. 
STDT 6014," An astronauts weight is different because the moon has less mass which means it has less of a gravitational pull than earth, you'd weigh less. "
STDT 2777, because the gravity is less on the moon than earth.
STDT 6016, Astronaut's weight is different on the moon because t he moon's surface gravity is weaker because the moon is smaller than the earth. 
STDT 6019," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth, because of the gravitational force pulling them down to Earth. A simpler way to put it, is that the astronaut will weigh more on Earth than on the moon. "
STDT 6020, On the earth an astronauts weight is almost double the weight on the moon because there is less gravity on the moon than there is on earth. 
STDT 6022, Why the astronaut`s weight would be different is because the moons mass is smaller so the astronauts weight would be different because there is less gravity.
STDT 6023, because the astronaut is floating. 
STDT 6024, It is different on the moon because on the moon or in space there is no gravity  
STDT 6027, because Eath has a differnet gravatational pull 
STDT 5454," The moon is  smaller  that the Earth, because the moon weigh less  six times then the  earth because the gravity is pulling. "
STDT 6035, The astronaut's weight is different because the moon's gravity is less than Earth's. As the astronaut gets further away from Earth his or her weight decreases but his or her mass stay the same.   
STDT 6043,"It is different because on the moon there is less gravity , which changes the weight of the astronaut. Weight depends on how much gravity there is."
STDT 6044, the moon has less gravitational pull than earth.  that's why it decreases astronaut's weight on the moon.
STDT 6045,Because of the mass.
STDT 6047, The force of gravity on an object is weight so that means that somewhere like the moon has less gravity so your weight decreases however Earth has more gravity so our weight increases.  
STDT 6050, weight is a force of gravity the more gravity the more weight you have so the less gravity the less you weight so if your in space you wouldn't weight a lot because  there is less gravity 
STDT 6053," An astronaut's weight is different on earth then on the moon because there is more mass on earth than there is on the moon. Causing less gravitational force.  As shown on slide four of lesson 1.01.  This is because the mass i so small, there is less room for gravitational force. Meanwhile, Earth is huge, so there is more space for gravitational; force.   I like to think of it as a class and a bus. The bigger the bus, the more kids can fit inside so there are more bags. The smaller the bus the fewer kids inside it which means the fewer bags. The kids being mass and the bags being the gravitational force.     Therefore, you weight more on Earth than you do on the moon. "
STDT 6055," There is less gravity on the moon, so you way less. "
STDT 6057," Because there is no gravity in space, you will now weigh anything but on earth, because there is gravity, you will weigh what you weigh. "
STDT 6060, maybe becausemoon dosentint have a lot of gravity 
STDT 6062, On the earth  gravity is  stronger 9.807 m/s² stronger then the moon the moon is1.62 m/s² different  from the earth.  
STDT 6063, The masses are different and the size 
STDT 6065," since earth has a bigger atmosphere than the moon, the moons atmosphere is not as strong as earths atmosphere. "
STDT 6067," The astronaut's weight is different, because on Earth, there is more gravity. On the moon, it has less gravity. More gravity helps the astronaut stay down and gain more weight. Less gravity helps the astronaut stay down, but she/he doesn't gain as much weight as on Earth. "
STDT 6068," Because the moon is smaller than the earth and about 60 percent as dense, the astronaut's weight is only about one-sixth of what it would be on earth. "
STDT 6076," There is no gravitation force on the moon but on the earth there is a gravitation force on earth. so, if you go on a scale on the moon you would have no weight rather then earth. "
STDT 6078," On earth we are closer, so the gravitational force is stronger, giving us our weight . That is why we will not float away. But on the moon we are far away, so the gravitational force does not reach us on the moon, making us not have weight. but have mass "
STDT 6081, The reason why astronauts weigh different on the moon is because there is no gravity in space. 
STDT 6085," An astronaut on Earth weights 175 pounds(778 N) and their mass is 79kg. On the moon, an astronaut weights 29 pounds(129 N) and their mass is 79kg. This is like this because weight depends on both mass and gravity and it changes wherever they are at. Weight increases at a location with more gravity, and decreases at a location with less gravity. The moon has less gravity than Earth, so astronauts weigh less when they're on the moon. "
STDT 6086, The amount of gravity is greater on Earth then the moon. 
STDT 6088,The weight is different because and astronaut's weight increases with more gravity and decreases with less gravity.  There is more gravity on earth than on the moon.  The mass stays the same.
STDT 6089, It is because there is less gravity on the moon. 
STDT 6090," The reason an astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth is because the amount of gravitational force on the moon is less than on earth. Therefore, their weight is less on the moon. "
STDT 6092,The moon has less mass and gravity because it is smaller than the earth. 
STDT 6095," The moon has less mass than Earth, so it has less gravity. Mass stays the same, but weight changes when gravity changes. On the moon, your weight is less because there is less gravity. "
STDT 6096, Because the mass of the moon is different do that means your weigh will be different 
STDT 6101, There weight on the moon is different because there's no gravity so if an astronaut weight about 100 pounds mass 45kg on earth with gravity.The with no gravity he would weight about 16 lb but his mass would still be the same 45kg. 
STDT 6102, The astronauts weight changed because the amount of gravity changed and mass cannot change in a persons body unless you're takingout some thing from the person.  
STDT 6105," The reason the weight is different on the moon and on the Earth is because, the moon has less gravitational force than the earth. Thats because the mass of the moon is less and the moon is smaller than the mass and size of the earth. "
STDT 6110," The astronauts weight is different because on the moon there is no gravity pushing down on them, so they weigh less, but on Earth they weigh more because there is gravity pushing down on their bodies. "
STDT 6115, Hour weight is different on earth and space because of gravity there is no gravity in space because the planets orbit instead of hitting them which means that an object falls towards a planet due to gravity that’s why space has no gravity and earth does
STDT 6118, On earth a man can be 201 lbs and gravity and mass can make him feel 201 or more. But on the moon the same man can feel like 35 lbs because gravity is less strong on the moon. That same man can feel like he's only 15 lbs in outer space because gravity and mass are not as strong as they are on earth. 
STDT 6125, the moon has less mass then the earth does.  the moon is far away from the earth so the astronaut ways less because he is far away from the earth 
STDT 6127," Since the moon has less gravitational pull than earth, astronauts on the moon would not be pulled down as much as they would be on earth. So, astronauts would be lighter on the moon than on earth."
STDT 6129, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon then on earth because the mass of the moon is smaller. This is because the less mass the smaller amount of a gravitational pull. 
STDT 6141, The earth is bigger and has a bigger gravitational 
STDT 6144,Mass stays the same but weight changes depending on the gravitational force. 
STDT 6145,The astronaut's weight decreases on the moon because there is less gravity on the moon then on earth.
STDT 2011," the gravity on the moon  is less than on the Earth's. So  the astronaut weight is  less on the moon than on Earth, but the astronauts weight  remains the same."
STDT 6148,"There is less gravity on the moon, so you way less. "
STDT 6151," The moon's gravity has less gravity than the earth's gravity, so the astronaut's weight on the moon is less than on the earth, but their mass is the same. "
STDT 6161,  An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because Earth has more mass which means more gravity pushing down on us. 
STDT 6163, On the earth there is more gravity so you weigh more. On the moon there is less gravity so you weigh less.
STDT 6164, Their weight is different on the moon because the gravitational pull in space isn't as strong than on earth so it makes the astronauts weight is decreased. 
STDT 6165, The weight of an astronaut increases in a place with more gravity and decreases in a place with less gravity.
STDT 6171," The moon doesn't have gravity, but on Earth there is gravity. "
STDT 6173, The moon has weaker gravitational pull than earth does. 
STDT 6174, The gravitational poles are weaker on the moon then they are on earth. 
STDT 6187, The astronauts weight is different on the moon because weight depends on the gravity.  The moon has less gravity than Earth. 
STDT 6188, An astronaut's body ways less on the moon compared to the earth. 
STDT 6192," On the moon, there is no gravity. On earth, gravity is pulling us down. "
STDT 6194," The moon's gravity is way less than Earth's gravity. Therefore an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on Earth, but the mass still stays the same. "
STDT 6199, The gravity there is less gravity on the moon then on earth 
STDT 6202, the moon is smaller than earth. which means that here is less gravity on the moon. because of the gravity it would look and feel like i weighed less.
STDT 6204," An astronauts weight on the moon would vary then their weight on earth because, weight depends on gravity and mass.         "
STDT 6206," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon has less mass, which means that his or her weight will be less. "
STDT 5567," there is less gravity in the moon. therefore, in the Earth there is a lot more gravitational force. this means that austronats can be able to jump and not be quickly pushed down.  "
STDT 6215, cas garavity is less on so the weight would be less 
STDT 6218," Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because mass weight refers to a measure of force and a object has both mass and gravity. The moon has less gravity than Earth, so in Earth you are going you are going to weigh more."
STDT 6220," When astronaut's go to the moon and earth they will realize that there weight will change this is because of gravity.Due to the location they are in the gravity will change and so will your weight. In areas with more gravity your weight will increase, but when they go to a place with less gravity your weight will decrease. "
STDT 6224, The reason why your weight is different on the moon than on the Earth is because there is less gravity on the moon. 
STDT 6225," On the moon, you are lighter because there is less gravity on the moon than on earth. "
STDT 6226, The strength of the gravity on the moon is made from the mass and size of it. 
STDT 6228, beacaus moon is bigger than the astronaut 
STDT 6230," An astronauts weight is different on the moon than on Earth because there is no gravity on the moon, and gravity will have an impact on things in the universe. "
STDT 6237," An astronaut can weigh 190 pounds but on the moon, they can weigh 20 pounds. "
STDT 6242, Because weight is just how gravity affects you. On earth you weigh more then on the moon because it has less gravity so in space you weigh nothing. 
STDT 6243,The less gravity there is the less weight astronauts will weigh.
STDT 6246," We weigh less on the moon because the gravitational force is greater on the earth, and less than the moon. The moon is smaller, so its gravitational field strength is only about one-sixth of the Earth's."
STDT 6251," There's less gravity on the moon than there is on the earth. Therefore, the astronauts' weight is less on the moon than it is on the earth. "
STDT 6254, It will be lighter because he is on the moon 
STDT 6255," If you went to the moon, you would weigh less even though your mass stays the same. "
STDT 6258,There is less gravity on the moon than on earth.
STDT 6260," An astronauts weight is different on the moon because of gravity, gravity is what makes you float in space so, an astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth on because of Gravity. "
STDT 6263,"   Our weight on the moon is less than it would be on Earth, this is because the difference on the strength of the gravity on the moon. Its determined from the size of the moon.  "
STDT 6265, Because the moon has less mass than the earth 
STDT 6269," An astronauts weight is different on the moon because the force of gravity is lighter because the moon is smaller object, therefore its pull on other objects is lighter, giving an astronaut the ability to jump even higher."
STDT 6274," Weight on the moon is lees than on Earth, because of a difference in the strength of gravitational pull. "
STDT 6281, due to the gravity of space.
STDT 6282, beacuse of the gravaty is diffrent on the moon 
STDT 6283, the moon has some gravity but the earth is full of gravity. 
STDT 6290, I think that the moon your weight is different because I think the moon has less gravite and that is why they are able o jump higher. The less gravite the less wight. 
STDT 6293, Because the moon doesn't have gravity so there weight is lower than there weight on earth. 
STDT 6295, because there is no gravity on the moon.
STDT 6297, the moon has less gravity than earth but space has non that why they can float. 
STDT 6301, He/she weight decreases on the moon because there is less gravitational pull than on earth. 
STDT 6302," The astronaut's weight on Earth is different, because there is gravity on Earth. We weigh more on Earth, because of this gravity. On the moon, there is no gravity, therefore our weight on the moon is non-existence. "
STDT 6305, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the gravity is different on the Earth and the moon. Gravity pulls your mass down and makes your weight. The Earth has more mass because it is bigger than the moon. That means there is more gravity pulling down on the astronaut so he will weigh more on Earth. 
STDT 6306," On Earth, the gravitational pull makes you more heavy because of the space between you and the center of Earth. It's called Gravitational force, and it's used to not make everything float in our everyday lives. Just imagine your floating house and cat. It doesn't exist (yet) because of this force discovered by Issac Newton. In outer space, on the Moon, you would weigh way less. This is because there is less gravity, almost none, to pull you back onto a surface. "
STDT 6309," If I were an astronaut and went to the moon that has a mass that's less than earth, my weight would be lighter. The reason for this is there is less gravity on the moon. Therefore, it has a weaker gravitational pull, making me weight less.  "
STDT 6310," On the moon, there is less gravity due to its size compared to the earth, yet the astronaut's mass does not change, and therefore there is altogether less gravity pushing on him and so he would weigh less. "
STDT 6311, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because there is less gravitational force on the Moon. 
STDT 6313, on the moon you would be lighter  
STDT 4132," Weight is a product of mass and gravity on an object. On earth, the gravity is perfect for making a measurement. Although the moon has little to no gravity, since weight needs gravity mostly to make a product of measurement, it would decrease the weight. When an object has both gravity and mass on an object, it makes a perfect product of weight, but when more gravity is involved, an increase in weight or less gravity would cause a decrease in weight . But your mass stays the same. "
STDT 6316," Objects on the Moon weigh less than they do on the Earth because the gravitational field strength is much less. On the Moon, astronauts can jump higher and leap farther than on Earth. For a given gravitational field strength, the greater the mass of the object, the greater its weight. "
STDT 6317, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because weight is a measure of force  
STDT 6318," The reason why an astronaut weighs more on Earth is because weight increases in a place with gravity, and weight decreases in a place with less gravity. Also, weight is the force experienced by an object due to gravity, and Earth has more gravity than the moon. That is why an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on Earth. "
STDT 6320, It would be different because the moon is further away from the center of the earth so the weight would be smaller 
STDT 6323,On earth there is more gravity than on the moon. The moon does have gravity but not as much as earth.
STDT 6326, An astronauts weight is different because there is less gravity which causes them to weigh less in space than on Earth. 
STDT 6328,"An astronauts weight is different on the moon then it is on Earth because gravity decreases in space and weight is based off of gravity, so therefore the weight decreases as well."
STDT 6332, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon has less gravity than the earth. 
STDT 6337," Your weight on the moon will decrease,because the planet has less mass, or less matter inside it. "
STDT 6338," Gravity affects the weight of people if the gravity is different, in which the gravity on the moon is lower gravity. Therefore, the weight on people is less due to gravity. "
STDT 6339," An astronauts weight, as well as anyone elses, is not dependent upon any solid principle or law. It is dependent on the force put upon you by gravity, in short the less gravity the less you weigh."
STDT 6340," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because weight is a measure of force, which requires an object to have both mass and gravity.  Mass is the amount of matter in an object while the weight is the force on an object by gravity. Since mass is the amount of matter in an object, the mass of something wouldn't change. The weight of something however, would change because the weight of something is the force of gravity on something.  "
STDT 6345, Well weight changes depending on location because weight is the force of gravity on a object. And the moon's gravity is less than earth's so that would mean that an astronaut would weigh less on the moon than on Earth. 
STDT 6347, The moon's is smaller so the gravitational pull is less on the astronaut. The Earths' mass is much larger than the moon so the gravitational pull on the astronaut is much greater. The astronaut would weigh more the earth because of the the greater gravitational pull by a larger mass earth. He would less on the moon.
STDT 6350, The weight which is the gravitational force is high on earth but not on the moon which means that the moon's gravity is not as strong as earth's. 
STDT 1522, Due to how much gravity is on the moon astronauts weigh less on the moon then the earth. 
STDT 6356, Gravity on the earth is stronger than on the Moon so he would weight more on Earth.  
STDT 6358, Weight on the moon is lower because there is weaker gravity. Mass is the same but weight changes if gravity changes. 
STDT 6360,An astronaut's weight weighs less on the moon than earth because the moon is smaller in mass than the earth. Because of the smaller mass there is less gravitational force which makes the astronaut lighter.
STDT 6363, The gravity makes him or her lighter. 
STDT 6365," A Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it's on earth because the less the place has gravity like the moon, the less you are going to weight. "
STDT 6366, Weight depends on both mass and gravity and there is not a lot of gravity in space or on the moon so you would not have a lot of weight that's why you jump so high on the moon because there is  very limited gravity
STDT 6369, The reason why an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth is because the gravitational pull between the astronaut and the moon isn't as strong as the gravitational pull between the astronaut and earth. 
STDT 6370," Earth has a gravitational pull because of its mass, but the moon is smaller and it has less of a gravitational pull."
STDT 6373," On the moon, there is less gravity. This means that you will weigh less on the moon than on earth because there is less gravitational force acting on you. "
STDT 6374, Because the earth has a greater gravitational force than the moon. 
STDT 6377, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon has a weaker gravitational force.The astronaut's weight is less on the moon because of this. 
STDT 6381, the reason that it is different on the moon then on earth.This is because when your on earth there are trees and all kinds of things that needs gravity.                        And when like you are in a rocket ship and you are landing on earth your rocket ship will burst in flame.And that is because you are crossing the atmosphere leaving space.so you do have gravity in earth because your not looking at or partly flying in space.So this is why astronaut's wight is staying down on the ground.     So on the moon you are abull to see space you do float in the air/space and the moon is not i repeat is not made out of cheese.the moon also does not have an atmosphere so that makes the astronaut's when they step forward they float in space. S this is why astronaut's wight is different on the moon than it is on the earth. 
STDT 6382, on the moon there is very little gravity other on earth there is gravity so on the moon you float around. 
STDT 6385, on earth your mass is  measured in kilograms and your weight is  measure in pounds a astronaught   can weight 175  and that will make the  astronaught weigh 29 pounds in  space
STDT 6386,"Because the moons gravity is less than earths's. So an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on earth, but the persons mass stays the exact same ."
STDT 6388,it is because there is a there is a strong gravitational strength on earth and on the moon there is not gravitational force   
STDT 6391,  An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because earth has gravity and space has no gravity causing the astronaut to have no weight . 
STDT 6393, There is less gravity than earth. We need gravity on earth to keep us from flying and on the moon u can float.  
STDT 6394," Astronauts weight is zero gravity so the mass and the weight is different. For example, their weight can be 200 pounds on earth but in space it can be 20 pounds because they are farther away from earth and the mass will change.  "
STDT 6395, The astronaut's weight is different on the Moon than Earth due to gravity. The moon has less mass that the Earth causing the astronaut on the moon to not be pulled down towards the moon like he would on Earth.
STDT 6396," The reason why is because weight depends on how much gravity is being asserted on you. On the moon, you have less weight because less gravity is being asserted on you. in space you have no weight because you have no gravitational force being asserted on you. "
STDT 6397, The moon has gravity but the earth has more gravity than the moon. So the astronaut weighs more on earth than the moon.
STDT 6398,The weight changes because of the change of gravity on the moon.
STDT 6416," Because,  there is no gravity on the moon like there is on Earth. That causes the artonaut's to float. "
STDT 6419, because the moon has less gravity than on earth 
STDT 6420, the astronaut is weightless on the moon cause the gravitational pull. 
STDT 6422," the Moon is smaller than Earth, it has a weaker gravitational pull. "
STDT 6424," The mass on the moon is less than the mass on the earth. Meaning that since the mass on the moon is smaller than the earth, gravity would pull you less on the moon, then on the earth. So since there is less gravity on the moon, the astronaut's weight would be lighter since the gravity is less. The mass would stay the same on the person, because they will not shrink, and they will not get bigger. "
STDT 6435," There is less gravity on the moon than on the earth, so that means there is less mass.   "
STDT 6438," The moon's gravity is less than Earth's, so an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on Earth, but his or her mass remains the same"
STDT 6439,An astronaut's weight is less on the moon than earth because due to the lack of gravity the astronaut's weight will change or be less.
STDT 6440, It is different because there is less gravity on the moon so you would float and if you were 725 pounds (0.33 t) on th moon you would be like24 pounds 
STDT 6443,Weight is the force of gravity on an object if there is less gravity there is less force so there is then less weight.
STDT 6444," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth due to gravity. Since weight depends on both mass and gravity, it changes depending on location.  "
STDT 6447, An astronauts weight is different in space then on earth because an object in a place with less gravity turns lighter than without. 
STDT 6453," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the moon has less mass than earth. Therefore , the astronauts' weight lessens. "
STDT 6457,the moon is smaller and has less gravity
STDT 6458," The moon is smaller which creates a smaller force of gravity, So that means an astronaut will be able to jump higher. "
STDT 6459, The weight of the astronaut increases in more gravity and decreases in less gravity. That is why the astronauts' weight decreased on the moon because it had less gravity. 
STDT 6461, The moon is smaller so it pulls us less than earth dose.
STDT 6462," When you are on earth you might weigh like 100 lbs, but in space you might weigh 20lbs.Weight is the measurement of how much that object or person is pulled to the earth or the ground. The reason that you weigh less on the moon than you do on earth is because on the moon there is less gravity than the earth which causes you and the moon not to have such a gravitational pull.  "
STDT 6465," Say an astronaut weighs about 120KG on earth, and half of that on the moon. this is because both have a different amount of density when it comes to gavity "
STDT 6477, The moon is smaller than the earth and your weight differs depending on where you travel. There is also no gravity on the moon. 
STDT 6479, The reason why an astronauts weight is less on the moon is because the moon has less mass than earth which makes it have less gravity. 
STDT 6480," On earth what ever you weigh that is your weight, but in space you don't have any weight but on the moon you lose a lot of weight but you still do have weight, and your mass stays the same. "
STDT 1632, astronauts weight is` different because the moons gravity is less than earth this is why astronauts  can have different  weight depending if there on earth or in the moon 
STDT 6482," This is because there is less gravity on the moon than there is on Earth, which makes the Astronaut lighter on the moon."
STDT 6487, Weight depends on the gravity but the mass will always stay the same.
STDT 6488,The astronauts weight is different on the moon then the earth because the gravity differences on earth gravity is pulling us down and gravity on moon does not really pull us down so the less gravity less we weigh and the more the more we weigh .
STDT 6489, because the gravity is less 
STDT 6491, Weight is a force of gravity. If a astronaut travels to a planet having a larger mass than of the earth acceleration due to gravity  on the planet will be larger then the astronaut will weigh more on earth 
STDT 6492," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth is because the moon is smaller than Earth which means it has less gravity than Earth, and because weight depends on the force of gravity on an object, that means that you will have less weight on the moon. "
STDT 6494, Your weight is different on the moon because there is less gravity than there is on Earth. 
STDT 6496, the moon has no gravity so on the earth you have gravity and more gravity makes more weight 
STDT 6498," It is different on the moon than on earth because on earth the pull of gravity affects the body of a person because they are used to no gravity, since on the moon there is no gravity. "
STDT 6500, It is different because the moon doesn't have as much gravitational pull as earth.
STDT 6502, The astronauts weight is different on the moon than on Earth because the moon has less mass than Earth so the gravity is less.   
STDT 6507," The weight of astronaut would be less on the moon, then on Earth because weight is how strong gravity pulls something/ someone down. "
STDT 6513, there is less gravity on the moon then earth because the earth has more mass 
STDT 910," The reason your weight is decreased on the moon, rather than staying the same amount as on earth, is because of its lack of gravitational pull. If you have less of a gravitational pull, you won't weigh as much as on earth; Having said that, your weight is decreased to around 6 times the amount on earth. "
STDT 6519," The earth's gravitational pull is stronger than the moons, so it pulls you towards earth more than it pulls you towards the moon. The more gravity pulls down, the heavier you are. "
STDT 6520, the weight changes because of the fluctuations in earths gravity 
STDT 6523, there is no gravity on the moon and there is gravity on the earth 
STDT 6525," The Earth weighs more than the moon, so the astronaut weighs more on earth than on the moon. The stronger gravitational force off the earth makes the astronaut weigh more. "
STDT 6528,because the moon's strength of gravity is weaker so there would be less weight  
STDT 6529, the astronaughts wheight is different on the moon because there is no gravity on the moon 
STDT 6531," The mass of the earth is more than the moon, so that means that there will be more gravity on the earth. "
STDT 6533, The reason why the astronauts weight is less on the moon is cause the moon has less gravitational pull. 
STDT 6534, An astronauts weight is different on the moon because the moon has a different amount of mass than Earth. Since earth is bigger than the moon it causes an astronaut's weight to be different on Earth than on the moon. 
STDT 6537," They are different because of gravity on earth. The gravity is stronger but on the moon it is weaker. If the earth had the same gravity as the moon, everything would become light and some even start floating. "
STDT 6540, An astronauts weight differ on the moon versus the earth because the moon has less gravitational force.  
STDT 6543," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the Earth. Weight is the measure of gravity. Earth has its own gravity in its atmosphere, and space has no gravity. Therefore, when you leave Earth's atmosphere, you will weigh nothing while being on the moon due to no gravitational force. "
STDT 6544," I think it's because the earth has a larger mass and the bigger the mass, the stronger gravitational force.                                                                                                The greater the gravitational the greater the weight.     "
STDT 6546, An astronaut's weight is different on the than on Earth because Earth has more gravity than it does on the moon. 
STDT 6559, it is different on the moon because there is less mass on the moon so if there is less mass there is less gravity.
STDT 6561, The astronaut's weight is lighter on the moon than on the earth because there is less gravity on the moon  than on the earth 
STDT 6563," The gravitational force is different on the moon because there is low pressure when you are away from earth, and you are very high in the air. "
STDT 6564," Because the moon has less gravity than the earth, it won't pull objects toward itself, so you will have less weight. "
STDT 6568, In space there is no graviton pull so there for they float but earth there is so it keeps us down on the ground 
STDT 6572," You weigh a different weight on the moon because Earth weighs you as kilograms(kg) or pounds (lb)... But your weight changes by location, so the moon is in outer-space so it deals with a lot of gravity and weight depends on both mass and gravity.  Kaila Stephens "
STDT 6575, An astronauts weight is different because on the moon the gravitaion is different. The mass on the moon is different too 
STDT 6579, becasuse the moon is heavier.
STDT 6580, the mass does not change the weight does because of the amount of gravity there is not as much gravity on the moon as on earth 
STDT 6582, The mass of the moon is less and that means it has less gravity than on earth so the astronaut isn't pulled down as much. 
STDT 6584," On Earth, the gravitational force is much greater than on the moon. Therefore, if an astronaut weighed 185 pounds, and his mass was 102, on the moon, due to the lesser gravitational force, his or her weight would be significantly reduced, but his or her mass remains the same. "
STDT 6588," Because the planets weigh different amounts, and therefore the force of gravity is different from planet to planet for example if u weigh 100 pounds on earth, you would weigh only 38 pounds on mercury."
STDT 6590,"An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because according to the text ""Since weight is the force of gravity on an object, the weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less."", and ""the moon's gravity is less than Earth's. So an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on Earth, but his or her mass remains the same."" These sentences explain how the weight on the moon is different from the weight on the Earth."
STDT 6594," The gravitational force is stronger on Earth than it is on The Moon because the Moon is smaller than the Earth and the Moon also has a lower gravitational pull, so when an astronaut lands on the Moon, the astronaut won't feel much of a gravitational pull.  "
STDT 6595,Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because moon gravity is 1.62 M/S 2 much lighter than earth's gravity which is 9.81 M/S 2. 
STDT 6597, on earth we mass but on the monn we less mass then we do on earth   
STDT 6598, The Earth's Moon has considerably less mass than the Earth itself and the gravitational is way less than the earth. 
STDT 6599," Earth has more mass than the moon, so it has more gravitational force. This means that even though the astronauts mass stays the same, his weight will vary because he is being pulled down different amounts. "
STDT 6602,The difference on the weight of a astronaut in the moon than on earth is the weight on the moon is less than it would be on earth due to a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon.
STDT 6605, A astronauts weight is different because weight rely's on mass and gravity and changes in different locations like on earth a astronaut weighs 150 pounds but on the moon he will weigh 20 pounds!
STDT 6614," There is no gravity on the moon, so often people or things don't have any or as much weight as they would on earth.  "
STDT 6616, Because the astronaut's weight will increase where there is more gravity. Earth has more gravity then the moon so the astronaut's weight is more in the earth then on the moon. 
STDT 6617," because of the Moons gravity, on earth, it pulls you down to the ground, but in the moon, you will just float! "
STDT 6619, the moon has less mass so it has less gravitational force keeping the astronaut on the ground 
STDT 3713," Because of mass, Earth's effect on us is different from on the Moon, which is less mass, making our weight different. "
STDT 6623,An astronauts weight is different on the moon because the gravity on the moon is less then earths gravity because the moon does not have nearly as much mass as the earth 
STDT 6625," An astronaut's weight would be different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon has less gravitational pull than on the Earth, and, weight is the force of gravity on a person or an object. "
STDT 1753, In space the gravitational force is low than earth 
STDT 6631, on the moon there is less gravity so there is less weight unlike earth where there is more gravity so there is more weight  
STDT 6638," An astronaut's weight is different on the Earth than on the moon because they are very different in size. The moon has a lot LESS mass than Earth so the amount of gravity pulling down on it (weight), is a lot less than the amount of gravity pulling down on Earth and its inhabitants. The Earth is a lot larger than the moon, so the amount of gravity pulling down on it is a lot more, causing its inhabitants to weigh a lot more on earth than on the moon. That is why the astronauts weight is different om Earth than on the moon.  "
STDT 6641," There is more gravity on earth than the moon, So with less gravity theres less weight! "
STDT 6644, The astronaut weighs more on earth and less on the moon because there is more gravity on earth then there is on the moon. 
STDT 6647,An astronaut's weight is different on earth compared to the moon because on earth we have more gravity than on the moon. Because of this we have less weight on earth than on the moon.
STDT 6651, On earth the gravity is stronger and would almost push down on the astronaut and make way heavier.  In space their is only micro gravity so the astronaut will be way lighter then on Earth.
STDT 6652," the astronauts weight in earth is like 160 pounds but the moons weight is like 20 pounds, but the kilos would be the same so being on earth is very different from the moon. "
STDT 6653," The moon has less gravity, so they will have the same mass, but they will weigh less, because less gravity is acting apon that mass. "
STDT 6655, because there is no gravity in space and no ozone layers the layers are on earth are diffrent the moon doesent have those 
STDT 6659,"  Weight is the force of gravity on an object, the weight of an object increases in a place with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. "
STDT 6664, the moon has less gravity 
STDT 6665, it is different because the moon is much smaller than the earth and therefor has less gravitational pull 
STDT 6669, it's because weight is a measure of force it requires an object to have both mass and gravity.
STDT 6670," Because, when you go to the moon, the weight will go less and it will low down the gravity, but when you go to the earth, the weight will go greater, and the gravity will go more. "
STDT 6672," The moon has less gravity than earth does, so the astronaut is still weighs the same but his mass changes due to the little gravity on the moon."
STDT 6678," The world's moon has way way less mass than the earth, I think? "
STDT 6682, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because of gravity. On the moon an astronaut weighs less because the moon has less gravity than Earth. Weight depends on both mass ang gravity. 
STDT 6685," Astronauts: Greater distance between them and earth, witch means less gravitational pull witch equals less force and therefore having less weight.     People on earth: The earth is huge, witch means there's more gravitational pull, witch equals more force, therefore having more weight. "
STDT 6686, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon has less mass than the earth. 
STDT 1798, Because weight depends upon gravity and mass but gravity on earth differs from gravity on the moon. 
STDT 6688, On Earth we have our normal weight and on the  Moon we have no weight at all. Why? Becasue of Gravity! 
STDT 6689," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because on the moon the gravitational force is not as strong as the gravitational force on Earth, therefore, astronauts are able to float for a few seconds to a minute while jumping, and on Earth if ANYONE jumps, they go right back down and gravity overcomes them. "
STDT 6696, An astronaut's weight is different because the gravitational force on Earth and moon are different. The gravitational force is stronger on Earth and so the astronaut will weigh more. 
STDT 6706," An astronaut's weight would be different on the moon than on earth because the size of the moon is much smaller than the earth, so it needs less gravitational pull than the earth needs. It's like having a ''piece of paper'' or the moon and a ''candle'' or the earth. The candle would obviously weigh more than the paper does. That would mean that the candle has more weight that needs gravity where as the piece of paper doesn't have much weight for gravity to hold on to. So the moon has less weight, which means less gravity, and the earth has more weight, which means more gravity. "
STDT 6709, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon then it is on earth because the gravity of the moon isn't as strong as the gravity on Earth. 
STDT 6833,An astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because there is less gravity and the moon has less mass.
STDT 6837,"An astronaut's weight is different on the moon then Earth because there is no gravity in outer space, so your weight is less on the moon. "
STDT 6838,"The mass is constant whether you're on the earth or the moon, but the acceleration force of gravity is less on the moon than the earth. Also, the mass of the moon is less than the earth which means that the moon has a weaker gravitational field. As a result, an astronaut's weight is less on the earth than it is on the moon. "
STDT 6839,the reason why an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth is because the gravitational pull is less than Earth's due to the size of the moon being smaller than Earth.
STDT 6911,On the moon you become lighter but if you come back down to earth your weight will increase. The only thing that does not change is your mass your mass could be 75  in the whole universe.
STDT 6916,"The astronauts weight is different on the moon than earth because the moon has less gravity than earth. Weight is made from mass and the gravity, so it will change depending on where the person is."
STDT 6918,its because it all depends on the gravity of the location the earth has a stronger force of gravity then the moon so your lighter on the moon than on the earth  
STDT 6920,An Astronaut's weight would be different on the moon because weight is the force of gravity an object experiences.
STDT 6931, the astronaut is weightless  in  space because  there is no gravity.  the astronaut  is weighted  on earth  because or\f the gravitational pull on  earth.  
STDT 6991," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon and on earth because, weight contains gravity and mass so if the gravity changes then the effect on the weight would be it would change to. So if your weight on earth is 100 pounds and your weight on the moon is 50 pounds it's because the gravity changed on one place to cause your weight change on the other. "
STDT 6994,The moons gravity is different compared to the gravity on earth because the moon is smaller.
STDT 6359,An astronauts weight is different on the moon then earth because on earth gravity pulls you down while in the moon you kind of float                                           
STDT 7043, The moon's gravity is less than earth's so an astronaut weighs less on the moon than os earth but his or her mass remains the same. 
STDT 7045,An astronauts weight is different on the moon then on earth because of the gravity on each. There is less gravity on the moon then on earth. So your mass is less on the moon because there is less gravitational pull. 
STDT 7046,there is less gravity on the moon to pull them down.
STDT 7047, in space there is no gravity so the astronauts would do things different on earth there is gravity so you will do things normal. 
STDT 7050,In a location that has a greater amount of gravity increases your force while less mass decreases it like how we have a strong gravitational pull on earth bt not as strong as a pull on the moon.
STDT 7051," he mass and weight will not change in space, but there is still no gravity to hold u down "
STDT 7055,It is different in space because of the gravity. on earth we have gravity so we don't float.
STDT 7056," The reason why astronauts weigh differently on the moon than on earth is that there is no gravity in space but there is tons of gravity on earth, which is why when we throw something in the air it immediately comes back down. On the other hand, when you jump in space you go back down slowly. "
STDT 7057, An astronauts weghit can change because  the moon will have less gravity then the earth. 
STDT 7061, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because on earth we have have gravity to hold us down and change our weight but in space there is no gravity so our weight is lighter 
STDT 7068," If you were on earth, your weight would stay the same, but if you were in space, there would be less gravitational force and less gravity, so you would weigh less. "
STDT 7069," Your weight would actually stay the same, but it would appear to be less because there is no gravity. "
STDT 7070,It would change because on the moon theirs a less gravitational pull on the moon since your in space.
STDT 7079,"    Weight is the amount of gravity/force that is pushing down on us. The earth's gravity is much stronger than the gravity on the moon. An astronaut may weigh less on the moon, but his mass will stay the same. "
STDT 7080,"On the moon there is lower gravity than there is on Earth, therefore we would weigh much less on the moon than we would on Earth."
STDT 7081, An astronaut's weight on the moon is different because the moon has less gravity than earth dose. 
STDT 7083, The weight of an astronaut is different because of less gravitational force.
STDT 7084," The reason why is, because the gravity strength is less on the moon, Earth has greater strength of gravity than the moon. Your weight will weigh less on the moon, but your mass will stay the same. "
STDT 7089," The gravitational force on the moon is weaker than on earth. Therefore, an astronaut's weight is not changed   "
STDT 7091," Have you ever wondered why an astronaut on the moon can jump 8 feet in the air? Or why do they look like they're struggling to walk across the surface of the moon? Well it's all because of  Gravity!  Here on earth we have lots of gravity so we can't jump so high and we can walk, normally. Now you might be saying ""AWWE MAN I WANT TO JUMP THAT HIGH"". Well, the thing is, if there was no gravity, you would just float into the abyss! But on the moon there is 0 gravity and you might think ""well, the astronauts have weight to keep them down, right?"". WRONG! Because there is 0 gravity, it takes away from their mass, whereas here on earth we have gravity to keep us steady and down to earth. "
STDT 7095," Weight depends on both mass and gravity.Mass is measured by kilograms, and  weight is measured in newtons. If the moon's gravity is less than the earth's gravity the astronaut will weight less than on the earth even though mass stays the same. "
STDT 7099, The reason why an astronaut's weight will change on the moon would be the amount of gravitational force and the location. The weight would always change depending on how much gravitational force it has. 
STDT 7103, There is a lot of gravity on the earth but little on the moon so the extra gravity on earth gives us extra weight.
STDT 7104," On earth, the gravity is very strong. For example, if I were to jump, it would bring me back almost immediately. See now on the moon, if you jump it would take a few seconds before feet are on the surface of the moon again. "
STDT 7105, An astronauts weight is different on the moon because there is less gravity pulling them down.  
STDT 7106, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the moon is smaller and has less gravitational force. 
STDT 7110," An astronauts weight is less on the moon because the moon is smaller than Earth, affecting the gravitational pull on the astronaut. Since gravity is effected by distance and weight you weigh less on the moon. "
STDT 7112, the astronauts ways less on the moon than on earth because the gravitational pull is stronger on earth than the moon.
STDT 7113," Weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because weight is the force of gravity. The weight in an object changes depending on the amount of gravity in an area. Meaning that in a place with less gravity like the moon, the weight of something will decrease. However, the weight of an object increases in a place with more gravity, take the Earth as an example. "
STDT 7114, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because the moon does not have both mass and gravity and the earth does. 
STDT 7116," Well we weigh less on earth because of gravity,and become weightless while on earth we have gravity that holds us down.. "
STDT 7119," As the gravity decreases so does weight, but mass stay the same because in space you don't shrink, so your mass stays the same. "
STDT 7123, the force of gravity is less on moon then on earth 
STDT 7124,"Weight is different on the moon than it is on earth, because weight increases due to gravity, and earth has more gravitational pull than on the moon. So you would weigh more on the earth and less on the moon."
STDT 7125, the moon i less then on earth. 
STDT 7126, Because there is less gravity. 
STDT 7128, Its because the mass of the moon is different than the earth.Its because the moon is smaller than the earth. 
STDT 7130, because the gravitational pull on the moon is less than the gravitational pull on earth. 
STDT 7133, The gravity is different. Nothing is pulling you down on the moon whereas on earth you are being held down by gravity. All in all there is less gravity on the moon to keep you in one place.  
STDT 7134,An astronauts weight is different because the moon has less gravitational force than Earth.
STDT 7135,"On earth the force of gravity weighs an object down giving it weight, so since there is no gravity on the moon it has nothing to weigh it down. "
STDT 7136," The  Moon  is smaller and has less mass than the  Earth , so its gravitational field strength is only about one-sixth of the Earth's. So, for example, a 120 kg  astronaut   weighs  1200 N on  Earth  but only 200 N on the  Moon . Remember that their mass would still be 120 kg. A 120 kg  astronaut   weighs  less on the  Moon  than they do on  Earth "
STDT 7140,  I think it is different because on earth gravity is stronger than on the moon 
STDT 7143, Well in the lesson we can see that an astronaut on earth can weight 175 pounds but on the moon the astronaut would weight only 29 pounds so there is a difference here. 
STDT 7144," An astronaut's weight will be different on the moon than on earth because the moon's mass is less than earth's mass, which  means gravity will pull on you less on the moon than on earth and that means that your weight is going to be different  on the moon than on earth. "
STDT 7148, Astronauts wait is different because the moon doesn't pull as hard as the earth. 
STDT 7152,"an astronauts weight gets lighter when farther away from earth because,the gravity on earth is great and as you move farther and farther away from earth the less gravity, and the less that you will weigh."
STDT 7162, In a place with less gravity your wait decreases. 
STDT 7163, Because there is no gravity so you weigh less 
STDT 7164, beacause the gravity is differint on the moon than the earth. 
STDT 3447, The astronaut weighs less on the moon because the moon has less gravity than the Earth because it is smaller. 
STDT 7169, Astronauts do not weigh as much when on the moon than on the earth. The moon has less mass than here on earth so astronauts weigh less on the moon and more on earth.  
STDT 7170, The astronaut's weight on the moon would be less because the gravitational force is weaker than it is on Earth. 
STDT 7174," Weight was calculated by both gravity and mass, although gravity on Earth differs from gravity on the Moon. "
STDT 7175," They weight is different because,on earth gravity pulls you down.On the moon you are like a feather, there is no gravity. "
STDT 7176, The gravitational pull is much less stronger than earths making stuff low gravity and weigh much less 
STDT 7177, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon from their weight on the earth because the gravitational pull of the moon is less. Gravitational force is less when the mass of the object is smaller. 
STDT 7179," Earth is bigger and has more mass than the moon, so the Earth's gravitational pull is bigger. Because of this, the astronaut weighs more on Earth but his mass stays the same. "
STDT 7181,"The astronaut's weight depends on the gravity. The moon has less gravity than Earth, so the astronaut's weight will be less than the weight on Earth."
STDT 7188,Astronauts weight is different on the moon then earth because the moon has gravity but not as much as earth does. Earth has way more mass than the moon does . So the astronauts weight will be lighter then what his weight would be on earth.
STDT 7189,if you were on a planet that had a greater mass then the gravity would raise. this is because the more mass something has the more of a gravitational pull it gives. which means if the planet your on has much more mass you would barely be able to jump
STDT 2979,"The moon is smaller than earth and, it’s not weighed by newtons."
STDT 7192," An astronaut's weight is lighter on the moon than on earth. For example, being on the moon is different than being on earth because of gravitational force. Why is it that being on the moon is different than being on earth? Well, being the moon, you know that the earth is bigger than you, so the earth is bigger, it has more mass, and that's why earth's gravitational pull is stronger. "
STDT 7193, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on the Earth because since the moon is small compared to earth the moon will have less gravity. Since earth is larger it has more gravity pulling down. 
STDT 7195, The weight increases in a location with more gravity. decreases in a location with less gravity. the astronauts weigh less on the moon because its less gravity. 
STDT 7197, The astronaut's weight is different because when he is on the moon he is measured in force because it has to have both gravity and mass and the reason its different on the earth is because on the earth he is measured in pounds or kilograms and newton.
STDT 7198, Our weight  on  moon  is less  than  it would be on  Earth  due to a difference of the strength of gravity on the  moon . The  moon's  gravitation force is determined by the  mass  and the size of the  moon. 
STDT 7205," On the moon this is no gravity so, you would fall slower and jump higher because of the gravity. "
STDT 7211, The mass of the moon is less than earth meaning that the gravity is smaller than the one on earth 
STDT 7219," The moon has gravity. On earth it has no gravity. On earth, if you drop a pencil it will fall. If you drop a pencil on the moon, it will float. "
STDT 7220, The astronauts weight is different on earth because the force of gravity is stronger on earth than the moon  
STDT 7225," An astronaut weight is different on the moon because the person is in the air far up in space, and you weight less on the moon. Also, the gravity is your on weight on Earth. "
STDT 7226, astronaut's  weight is different because there is less gravity
STDT 7228, Let's say on earth you weigh more but on the moon you'd weigh less because there is less gravity and  less gravitational force. 
STDT 7229,    An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon has a weaker gravitational pull. So the astronaut's weight is heavier on the Earth. 
STDT 7230, Because the farther you leave Earth the less gravity you have and the less gravity you have the less you weight.  
STDT 7231,there less gravity in the moon and it wouled mean less weight
STDT 7235, On earth there is a lot of gravity I mean a lot. So we weigh in pounds normal. But when your on the moon there is less gravity and that makes you weigh different. Like if you in school on earth everything would stay in its place on the ground. But if your at school on the moon then every thing well be out of its place and off the ground and will floating in the air. You probably will NOT like it.
STDT 7237, An astronaut's weight would be different on the moon because the gravity on the moon is different from earth 
STDT 7242,An astronaut’s weight is different on the moon than it is on the Earth because the moon’s gravitational force is weaker than Earth’s. The astronaut’s weight decreases on the moon although his mass does not change. 
STDT 7247, The weight of an astronaut is different on the moon than it is on the Earth because on Earth you have more gravity so there is more weight pulling you down rather than on the moon there is less gravity pulling you down so you do not weigh as much. 
STDT 6393, The weak gravitational pull is different on the moon. 
STDT 7261,An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon has little to no gravitational force and earth has more.
STDT 7264," Since theres less gravity on the moon, it makes the astronauts weight less than on the earth because earth has more gravity. "
STDT 7265, The Moon has smaller mass than Earth meaning it has less gravitational force on your body.Weight is the measurement of gravitational force meaning the less force there is the less weight there is. 
STDT 7266, Because you can weigh 200 pounds but when you leave the atmosphere your mass decreases 
STDT 7276," An astronaut's weight on earth is different than on the moon due to gravity. Even though the weight of the astronaut doesn't change, there is less gravity on earth which will cause the astronaut to float. "
STDT 7280, becuse its smaller gravity on the moon then earth 
STDT 7285,"An astronaut would weigh less on Luna (our moon) than here on Earth because our moon is smaller than Earth and therefore has less mass, so it also has less gravity."
STDT 7286, if you were on earth then you would have normal weight and mass but when you get farther away like to the moon your weight changes on location but the mass stays the same 
STDT 7289, The astronaut weights less on the moon than on earth. The moon has less gravity force than the earth and the mass on the moon is less than the earth. 
STDT 465, An astronaut's weight is different because there is less gravity on the moon which means the astronaut weighs less. 
STDT 2174, because the gravity is less on the moon than on earth 
STDT 7297," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth,because weight is determined by gravitational force and the moon has less gravitational force than the Earth ,so an astronaut weighs more on Earth. "
STDT 7300," Why an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth is because of gravity. There is no gravity on the moon, so less mass.  "
STDT 7303, SO the astronauts went to the moon and yes the weight did change the weight was 175 lbs and when they went to the moon they weight 29 lbs.SO the mass it will stay the same it will not change. 
STDT 7306,As the astronaut get's further from earth the gravity decreases that makes the gravitational force less.  
STDT 7312,the astronauts weight is different on the moon because there is less gravity on the moon then on the Earth because the moon is smaller than the Earth.
STDT 7315, Because the Moon is weaker than Earth through gravitational pull. That means it causes you to weigh lighter than you do on Earth. 
STDT 1666, An astronaut's  weight on the moon than on earth is different because the moon don't have any gravity but earth has gravity. 
STDT 7319," The Moon has less gravity than the Earth, thus making an Astronaut lighter. "
STDT 7322, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the gravitational force isn't as strong as it is on earth. 
STDT 7323,"Due to the fact, the moon is smaller, so it has less mass, there is less gravity pushing down on things."
STDT 7326," Because the gravity is stronger on the Earth than on the moon, so the astronaut would weigh more on Earth. "
STDT 7331," When you are on earth If your weight is directly related to how much gravity pulls on you. If you were to stand on the moon, you would weigh less because the moon mass is less than earth it is small because the moon's mass is less than earth's mass. gravity will pull on you less well you on the moon. "
STDT 7332, The moon has less mass than earth 
STDT 7336, The weight increases and the mass stays the same. 
STDT 7339,"earth is bigger so it has more gravity, unlike the moon is smaller so it has less gravity. so the astronaut would weigh more on earth cause there's more gravity."
STDT 7340," There weight changed because there was less gravity on the moon, and there was no mass change because there is no change in mass going from planet to planet. "
STDT 7341," Its becuase the moon is smaller than the earth, which means it has less mass and a weaker gravitational pull. "
STDT 7343," On earth the astronaut weight is measured by weight and in space the astronaut is measured by mass. Also, weight is heavier than mass. "
STDT 7345,because of the gravitational pull 
STDT 7346,an astronaut weight is different because the amount of gravity in space is less than the amount on earth.
STDT 7347, The weight of an astronaut is different on the Earth than the moon because Earth has more mass and gravity than on the moon. 
STDT 7350," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because weight is the mass and gravity on the object. The astronaut's mass is the same everywhere. What is different is the force of gravity on the moon and the Earth. On the moon, there is less gravity so the astronaut's weight is lower on the moon than on Earth. The Earth has greater gravity so the weight of the astronaut on Earth is greater. "
STDT 7354, An astronaut would weigh less on the moon than earth because of the amount of gravity. Gravity effects your weight therefore causing him or her to weigh less. 
STDT 7356," The difference is that mass refers to the amount of matter in a object, but weight is the force experienced by an object due to gravity. "
STDT 7359," The moon has less gravity and with less gravity, it makes you weigh less than you would on earth where there is more gravity. "
STDT 7360,"There is less force of gravity on the moon, so that is why an astronaut's weight is different."
STDT 7361,the moon has less gravitational pull due to the fact that it has less mass and it is smaller.
STDT 7365, An astronts weight is diffrent because theres no gravity in space so he will float up instead of down. 
STDT 7366, Weight is different on the moon then Earth because the moon has no gravity but Earth does. 
STDT 7369, When the human body touches the moon they have no gravity and when u have no gravity u don't weigh anything so u can jump high. But when the human body touches the earth u have weight because the earth has gravity. The earth and the moon are different the earth has gravity but the moon dosent have gravity.  
STDT 7371,An Astronaut weighs less on the moon than on earth because there is greater gravitational force.
STDT 7374, On the moon your weight is different than on earth so if you were to go to the moon you will be lighter than you are on earth but whenever you go back to earth  there is 100% you will come back the same weight.   
STDT 7382, the gravity decreases   
STDT 7384, because the gravitational force on the moon witch is less than on earth. 
STDT 7386, Objects on the moon way less then on earth so your going to weigh different  on the moon then earth because gravitational fields strength is less on the moon they can jump higher on moon then on earth your floating on the moon earth your walking. 
STDT 7387, On the moon there is no gravity so there is less pull on the astronaut which would result in less weight. When there is no gravity to hold you down like on the moon you will float. On Earth there is gravity and we have more weight holding us down.  
STDT 7396, An astronauts weight is less on the moon than on Earth.  This is because the moon has less gravity than earth does. 
STDT 7397," There is more gravity on the Earth than on the Moon. Your weight depends on the gravity, so you weigh less on the Moon. "
STDT 7401, Because the moon dose not have as much mass as the earth so the gravitational force is decreased
STDT 7405," An astronaut's weight would be different on the moon because the gravitational pull on the moon is a lot smaller than on earth.  Since the Earth has more gravity, the astronaut's weight will be more although the mass will stay the same.       "
STDT 7407, The moon has a different gravitational pull. 
STDT 7420, An astronauts weight on the moon will be less than it would if it was on the earth because of a difference in strength of gravity on the moon. The moons' gravitation force is determined by the mass and how big the moon is. That means if you walk or go on the moon your mass will stay the same as it is on earth but your weight will decrease. 
STDT 7424, Because of the difference in mass on each planet 
STDT 7429," Because there is less gravity on the moon, the astronaut weighs less than he would on Earth."
STDT 7430,Your weight on the Moon is different from your weight on Earth because there is less gravity on the Moon than Earth your weight on earth is more because there is more gravity pulling on you increasing your weight than on the Moon with less gravity
STDT 7431, The weight of an astronaut will increase on the earth because the gravitational strength is greater than the moon's gravitational strength therefore the moon will decrease their weight.  
STDT 7436," Because there is more gravity in space than there is on Earth, although the astronauts' mass would stay the same. "
STDT 7439," On the moon, the astronaut would lighter because the moon has less mass than earth. It has less gravitational force. "
STDT 7441,"An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than earth is because of the weight. The weight on the moon for an astronaut is lower than earth. For example, on earth an astronaut's weight is 175 and on the moon its 29 pounds (lb)."
STDT 5364, the weight on the moon is less on earth bc the moon doesn't have gravity but on the other hand earth does 
STDT 3816, The astronaut's weight is different because there is no gravity on the moon and there is gravity on the earth.  
STDT 7448," Because the gravitational pull on the moon is way different than the Earth's, a person's weight would decrease. "
STDT 7449, It is because the amount of force on an object and gravity. The earth has gravity and the moon does not have gravity.  
STDT 7450," An astronaut's weight is different because they are farther away from the center of the earth so they weigh less. Since the astronaut is up in space, he or she feels less the effect of gravitation, to the point that he or she can even float"
STDT 7451,On the moon the gravitational pull is not as strong so you are less affected by gravity and you aren't pushed down as much.
STDT 7452,the astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because on the moon there's no gravity anywhere besides earth.
STDT 7453,"In my opinion, it would probably be because of the Surface gravity of the moon is 1.62 m/s2 while the earth is 9.81 m/s2.  "
STDT 7454, Well the moon has less gravity then the earth makeing the Astronauts weight a mass of 100kg 
STDT 7455, When there is less gravity like on the moon you weigh more but when there is more gravity you weigh less like on earth because weight is the force of gravity on an object. 
STDT 7456, The Earth has more gravitiatonal pull than the moon does. So you would weigh more on Earth than the Moon because Earth is pulling you down to it more. 
STDT 7458," The reason an astronaut's weight changes on the moon than on Earth, is because it is smaller than Earth and so there is a less gravitational pull than on Earth, so the astronaut will be lighter on the moon than on Earth.  "
STDT 7463," Well, on the moon there is less gravity. But, on earth there is more gravity. Which is why on the moon astronauts weight is less. And which is also why, on earth astronauts weight is more than on the moon. - sorry if my answer is not long, just email me if it needs to be longer. And, also sorry if it mostly matches the lesson, I tried my best to reword it. :) "
STDT 7466," On Earth there's more gravity, so the astronaut weighs more. On the moon there is less gravity, so the astronaut weighs less.  "
STDT 7467," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth, Beacuse there is less gravity on the moon. Beacuse the moon is smaller, He would way more on earth then the moon."
STDT 7468, The moon has less mass than the Earth causing it to have a smaller gravitational pull on the astronaut. This will make his weight less than on Earth. 
STDT 7469,"The Earth has more gravity and the moon only has 20% of gravity. So on the moon you are measured by newtons, so you weigh less  on the moon than on the  Earth. "
STDT 7471, your mass is measured in kilograms (kg) and your weight is measured in pounds. It also depends on location.
STDT 7473, gravitational force is not there so it doesn't  matter how much they way they will slowly be pulled near earth. ` 
STDT 7480, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the weight of an object decreases in a place with less gravity. 
STDT 7483,Because on earth your mass it is measured in kilograms (kg) and your weight is measured in pounds (Ib) or in way scientific way newtons (N).
STDT 7484, Because there is a stronger gravitational force on earth than on the moon  
STDT 7494, The less mess a planet has the less gravity is on the planet which eagles to less of the astronaut's weight 
STDT 7495, It is because the weight on the moon is less than it is on Earth because there is a diffrent strength of gravity. 
STDT 7496," The moon has less mass, therefore it has less of a gravitational pull making the astronaut weight less. The earth has more mass, making the astronaut weigh more. "
STDT 7504, His weight would be less because there is no gravity on the moon. On earth there is gravity so his weight would be more on earth than the moon. 
STDT 7507, There is less gravity on the moon so your weight is less than it is on Earth. 
STDT 7513,The astronauts weight is different because their body will float and be all bouncy while Earth people are dragged down. 
STDT 7514,"An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because weight is the gravitational force put on an object with mass. Since the moon is much smaller than earth and has a weaker gravitational pull, the astronaut's weight will be about 1/6 of his/her weight on earth."
STDT 7516, An astronaut's weight would be different because on the moon there is less gravity. 
STDT 7521, A astronaut weight is different when they are on the moon and in earth there weight is difference because there is air and that makes it no gravity which makes them float. 
STDT 7525, It is different because the moon has less gravitational force. 
STDT 7526, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon and on then it is on Earth because the gravity is different i this two places. The strength of the gravity is smaller than it is on Earth. Weight is measured by how hard the gravity pulls you down. The greater the pull of gravity on an object the more it is going to weight.
STDT 7527,The weight of an object means the amount of gravity that pulls down on an object or person. This means that if you are near earth then gravity will pull you toward earth if you are in space than gravity will not pull you because there is no gravity.
STDT 2904," Because gravity works differently on the moon, the gravitational pull is less on the moon. "
STDT 7530," The weight between earth and the moon is very different on earth. There is gravity, so it pulls you down, so you are heavier. On the moon there "
STDT 7531,gravity is in effect on earth but is not as strong on the moon.
STDT 7532,the moon has no gravity the earth witch makes you way half as much on moon than the earth. 
STDT 7537," There is less gravity on the moon. Also, weight needs gravity to be a big number. meaning if you are in space and you brought a scale with you, checked yourself on it, it would be zero. "
STDT 7542," The weight changes due to how far an object is to another object, but mass stays the same for example weight by earth= 175 ibs (778 N) mass= 79 kg weight by the moon = 291 ibs (129 N) mass = 79 kg  "
STDT 7547,The gravity is stronger on the earth than on the moon.
STDT 7549,Because the mass on the moon is smaller the gravitational force is less so you weigh less on the moon than you do on earth.
STDT 7553," There is less gravitational force on the moon there is on the Earth, which explains why when astronauts visit the moon and walk or jump into the air they float higher than they would on Earth. "
STDT 726," Now, standing on the Moon, the Earth is still pulling on you. But, because you are so far away, we say that you are “outside its sphere of influence.” So, almost all the force you feel pulling on you is coming from the mass of the moon.       "
STDT 7559, The astronaut's weight changed because there is less gravity on the moon. 
STDT 7562," On Earth it has gravity, so we weigh more, but in space there is no gravity. So we weigh less. "
STDT 7564, theres less gravity on the moon 
STDT 7565, Astronauts weight is different on the moon than earth because the gravitational pull on the moon is less than on the earth because it has less mass 
STDT 7566, The moon has gravity and the earth does not. 
STDT 7568,"An astronaut weigh lesser on the moon when compared to earth because of the surface gravity of the moon. Since the moon is smaller than Earth, it has a weaker gravitational pull."
STDT 7570, It's because when gravity changes so does your weight Because you get lighter in space. 
STDT 7574, in space there is no gravity so your not going to have any weight on earth gravity is there so you will not float see it as jumping in space when you jump your gonna float but on earth your going to go right back down when you jump 
STDT 7581,"The moon has less gravity then the earth has, as the astronaut floats up when he's on the moon he has decreased in weight because there is less gravity on the moon then there is on earth."
STDT 1436," because the gravitational pull is stronger on earth because earth's bigger, and the gravitational pull on the moon is less strong because it's smaller than earth. "
STDT 7583," The earth is bigger and heavier than the moon, therefore it has more gravity than the moon, so if you are on the moon it will have a less amount of gravitational force. "
STDT 7585, Astronaunts  weight is different on the moon than Earth because the gravitational force is greater on the earth than the moon.
STDT 7588," The weight is different because it depends on location. Weight is the force of gravity on an object, so when the astronauts are on the moon the weight is different because there is less gravity. "
STDT 7591, they have less gravitational pull  
STDT 7597,Since weight depends on Mass and gravity so if you are on the Moon there isn't gravity so you just have Mass 
STDT 7599," An Astronauts weight is different on earth then it is on the moon because there is less gravity on the moon then there is on earth, so there weight will be different. Astronauts weight will be different on the moon then on earth but there mass stays the same. For example if a person weighs 170 lbs on earth, on the moon they might weigh 15 lbs but there mass would stay the same as it would be if they were on earth. "
STDT 7600, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because it has more gravity which means the weight decreases.  
STDT 7603," The moon has less gravitational force and, since the moon is smaller, it has less mass, which means less gravitational  pull.  "
STDT 7604,The moon has less gravitational pull.
STDT 7607, Astronauts weigh more on the earth than they do on the moon. The reason is because of the gravitational force. On Earth you will weigh more than on moon that is because that is because the moon has less gravity than the earth. 
STDT 7609, less gravity because of the size change from the earth to the moon so less gravitational pull. 
STDT 7611,The astronauts weight is less on the moon because there is less gravitational force on the moon. Where as an astronauts weight on Earth would be more because there is more of a gravitational pull on Earth.
STDT 7613," If they are far away, they stretch/get bigger because they are going farther. If they are closer, they get smaller because they are coming toward and not farther. "
STDT 7614," Due to little gravity on the moon, the astronaut's suit feels light to the point that the astronaut feels like they can fly away, but when on the ground the suit weighs around 300pounds. So that when gravity comes in, helping the user not carry hundreds of pounds but instead makes them feel super light. "
STDT 7615," You will be lighter than usual because there is less gravity on the moon then Earth! It's crazy because people think that you will be a bit heavier than usual on Earth. Even tho space is far doesn't mean that you can't make it here in a rocket in 2 hours, at full thrust. "
STDT 7624, Because on earth the gravitational force is stronger than on the moon 
STDT 7629,because the gravitation pull is different on the moon than earth
STDT 7634, On the moon there is not any gravity so the astronaut's weight would be less than on earth. 
STDT 7635, there is less gravity on the moon than on the earth
STDT 7640," The astronaut has more weight on Earth than on the moon because the Earth has more mass, which makes more gravity, so the astronaut has more weight. The moon, however, has less mass and has less gravity,  so the astronaut has less weight. "
STDT 7641," The reason I think our weight changes on the moon is because, on the moon, gravity is not as strong as the earth's gravity which our body is used to, so we float. So to answer your question, it is because the gravity on the moon is not as strong as the gravity on earth. "
STDT 7644," The astronaut's weight changed because of their location. Weight is the force experienced due to gravity, and the moon has very little gravity so that is why the astronaut's weight changed. "
STDT 7646,because on the moon there is less gravity then on earth.
STDT 7648, The astronauts weight is different because objects on the moon weigh less then they do on earth. The gravitational strength is less. 
STDT 7652," An astronaut is lighter in space because the farther he gets, the  gravitational pull gets weaker and weaker till it is no longer there. "
STDT 7658, An Astronauts weight on earth and the moon would be two completely different things. The mass of earth is large and vast while the moon is several times smaller in terms of mass. The mass of an object determines its Gravitational pull or force. The larger the mass the more gravitational pull. The definition of Mass is the matter of substance in an object. In this case if the moon is several times smaller than earth then it would have several times weaker gravitational force then earth. That's why when ur on the moon U feel lighter and can jump higher because there is less gravity keeping u on the ground. It is truly stunning how gravity works! 
STDT 7659,"If the force of gravity on an object is the weight, then weight of an object becomes more in a location with more gravity and will become less in a place with less gravity. Therefore, an Astronaut on the moon would weigh less because the moon is smaller than Earth and has less gravity."
STDT 7661," There is no gravity on the moon, so the mass is less "
STDT 7663, The difference of an astonaut's weght is diiferent on the moon and on earth because of gravitivity. 
STDT 7664, An astronaut's weight on Earth is much heavier than on the Moon because gravity in space is alot less than on Earth. 
STDT 7667, its because weight measures of force because it requires both mass and gravity  
STDT 7668, The moon has less gravity than Earth. 
STDT 7679," because on earth our weight is pulled toward the center of the earth, which is gravity, but on the moon the weight is different because there is no gravity on the moon. "
STDT 5686, it would be different because a human weighs nothing in specie  
STDT 7684, Because the Earth has more gravity than the Moon.
STDT 3575," A astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because there is barely any gravity on the moon or in space at all than there is on Earth. So of course, you'll weigh less in space than you do on Earth all because of gravity."
STDT 7693, The reasons why astronaut's weight different on the moon is because of gravity it makes people who go to space lose weight then in the earth. 
STDT 7695, An astronauts weight is different on earth than in outer space because on earth we have more mass but in space the mass will decrease making us have less mass. 
STDT 7697," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because on the moon there is less gravity than there is on earth. With less gravity, the weight of the astronaut will decrease. "
STDT 7706, An astronaut weights less on the moon than on earth because the moon has less gravity than the earth does.  
STDT 7707, The astronaut would weigh much more on the other planet than on the Earth    
STDT 7708," Because earth has gravity, and outer space does not have gravity."
STDT 7709," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon has less gravity which makes everything lighter. The moon is also smaller in size too. Here on Earth, since it has more gravity, everything weighs more. The Earth is also larger in size. "
STDT 7710," An astronaut's weight is different because there is no gravity on the moon, so there for he will probably have very little weight.  "
STDT 7711," When an astronaut is on the moon, the astronaut is farther away from Earth and the moon is smaller than the earth so the gravity is less "
STDT 7712,"On Earth the average astronaut's weight is around 175 pounds. But on the moon the same astronaut would be around 29 pounds! And why is it so different? Mass refers to the amount of matter in the object, but since the weight both on mass and gravity it changes depending on the location you are in!"
STDT 7713,"An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon mass is less than Earths mass, gravity will pull you less, and it is smaller. When you're on Earth your weight is directly related to how much Earths gravity pulls you. "
STDT 7718,A astronaut's weight is different on the moon because there is no gravity on the moon unlike the earth.
STDT 7723, An astronaut weight is less on the moon than earth  because the moon has less gravity than earth. 
STDT 7725,"The moon is smaller , so the gravity is less. Making the astronauts weight  less.  "
STDT 7726,Because it no gravity on the moon and on earth the gravity pulls toward the ground.
STDT 7727," Its different because weight changes depending on location. Weight is the force of gravity on an object, the weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. "
STDT 7732,because there is less gravity on the moon
STDT 7733,An astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on the earth because weight is a measure of force - it needs something to have the pair of mass and gravity. The moons gravity is less than than on earth. So the astronauts weigh less but their mass stays the same.
STDT 7735," The weight is different because there is more gravity on earth and less gravity on the moon. More gravity means more weight, less gravity means less weight.  "
STDT 7741, B/c on earth there is a gravitational force that pulls us down. But on the moon there is no gravity to pull us down so on the moon we are 6 times lighter (well that is if you'ur 80lb like me).  
STDT 7742, The moon is smaller and less dense then Ethrth. 
STDT 7745, The astronauts weight would decrease on the moon because the moon doesn't have as much mass as the earth so that means the moon as less gravity. Weight is a mixture of an objects mass and the gravity of the person. 
STDT 7746, Because there's no atmosphere on the moon 
STDT 7751, because there is no gravity on the moon 
STDT 7755, because in space there's no gravity.    
STDT 7756," More mass of a planet equals more gravitational force. Since the moon has less mass than the Earth, and since weight is the force put on a body or object due to gravity, the weight will be less on the moon than when someone is on Earth. "
STDT 7757, The astronaut would weigh less on the moon because the moon has less mass and less gravity than earth. 
STDT 7758, An astronaut`s weight is different on the moon than it is on earth is because there is less gravity on the moon than earth. 
STDT 7766," On Earth, the gravitational pull of Earth's core is stronger than that of the moon's core, and therefore your weight is lower on the moon than your weight on Earth. "
STDT 7771," Earth has more gravity, so you weigh more. The moon has less gravity, so you way less because of gravity. Your weight is because of the gravitational force. "
STDT 7784,The moon has no atmosphere so you are lighter. 
STDT 7787, Weight is measured by mass and gravity and there is no gravity on the moon. 
STDT 7789,"Since weight is a force of gravity on an object, it will increase and decrease depending on if the location has more or less mass. "
STDT 7791," The moon is a lot smaller than the earth, and has no atmosphere therefore the moon has less gravitational pull on the astronaut "
STDT 5189," An astronaut's weight is very different when he/shes on the moon, It quickly decreases. You can go from 189 lb's to 79 kilograms. "
STDT 7793," An astronaut is heavier on earth because the astronaut is closer to the earth than the moon and there is more gravity.The same astronaut can be light on the moon because, space is still pulling the astronaut, so the moon has less gravity. "
STDT 7794,"The astronaut's weight did change due to gravity. The more further the astronaut was away from earth, the less weight the astronaut had."
STDT 7795, The mass of the astronat's was 67 weight was 156 and on the moon his/hers weight went down but he/her was the same mass because of gravity. 
STDT 7797,An astronaut's weight is different on the moon then on earth because the moon is smaller then the earth so it has less mass.
STDT 7798," The reason an astronaut weighs more on Earth than on the moon is because, Earth has more gravity and the moon has less gravity. That means the weight of the astronaut increases on Earth and decreases on the moon.    "
STDT 7804, People way less on the moon because of the mass of the moon is allot less the IT is on earth which effects the gravity . 
STDT 7805," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because your mass will not change, but your weight is depending on the amount of gravity. Earth has more gravity than the moon, so the astronaut is going to weight less on the moon than on Earth. There is less force holding her down. The further you are from objects means less force and less gravity. "
STDT 7808," It depends on the gravity of the area. If there is lots of gravity, there would be more weight. If there was less, then there would be less weight. "
STDT 7812, because in space there is no gravity pulling you down. 
STDT 7813, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the weight of an object decreases at a location with less gravity. 
STDT 7817, the weight of the astronaut decreases to less gravity.The gravitational force and the mass and density changes.  
STDT 7820," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because there is less gravitational force on the moon and more gravitational force on the earth.  The mass of the earth is greater than the mass of the moon.  Therefore, the earth has more gravitational force than the moon. "
STDT 7825, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because the earth is bigger than the moon and because earth has more gravity. 
STDT 7829," An astronaut on the moon would weigh less on the moon because there is less gravity and the further away from gravity you go your weight decreases, but if you were on earth, then you would weigh more because earth has more gravity. "
STDT 7838, An Astronaut's weight is different on the moon because of gravity. Gravity changes astronauts' weight because of mass and gravity.peoples mass does not change only there weight. Weight changes depending on the location. That is how your weight changes on the moon. 
STDT 5361, Mostly Known that the moon has lesser gravity as you experience right now and on earth as well as the moon being much smaller than the earth's regular size and 60% dense as the astronauts weigh about one-sixth of what it would be on earth 
STDT 7844, because earth has gravity the force of attraction which makes thing fall to the center of the earth and it would seem you weigh more on earth cause the moon doesn't have that.   
STDT 7845," because earth has gravity, the moon dose not  and  it takes a while to get to the moon because it's so far away.   "
STDT 1840, Because on the moon objects weigh less than they do on earth. 
STDT 7847, Earth has gravity and the moon does not have gravity.
STDT 7848," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth, because the gravity pull on the moon is less than earths, which affects it, making our mass less.  "
STDT 7851," The Earth has a greater amount of gravity than the moon. The gravitational force was pulling them down, so they weigh more on Earth. "
STDT 7854, Astronauts weigh less on the moon and more on earth because gravity attraction is less on the moon. 
STDT 7855," Gravity affects your weight, so when you are where there is more gravity, your weight increases.So when you are on earth, there is more gravity, when you are on the moon your weight deceases because there is less gravity than there is on earth.  "
STDT 7856," It's different because the gravitational pull is less on the moon, than it is on the earth. "
STDT 7858, The earth has a different gravitational force than the monn's .The Earth's gravitational force is stronger than the moon's. That is why an astronaut weighs more on earth tha on the moon.
STDT 7966, They weigh less on the moon because the earths gravity is stronger because it has more mass than the moon. 
STDT 7967, On earth there is gravity and in space there obviously isn't so that effects something plus the space suet that puts on some weight but that doesn't make them heavy you see because of the lack of gravity there weight goes down. 
STDT 7968," An astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon's gravity is less than Earths. But, the mass would stay the same.  "
STDT 7970,An astronauts weight is different on the moon than on earth because the weight on earth makes it so you will come straight down to the ground while on the moon you will go higher then you can on earth
STDT 7971,There is less gravity in the moon because the moon is smaller. 
STDT 7972, cause they dont  weigh anything in space 
STDT 1210," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because, on earth gravity pulls you down and on the moon not so much     "
STDT 7986, It is different because the gravitational force on the moon is weaker than the gravitational force on the earth. 
STDT 7989," The Earth has more gravity then the moon, so the astronaut weighs less, but the mass of the astronaut stays the same. Somewhat like when you swim in a pool, and you feel weightless. since the earth has more gravitational pull its inhabitants weigh much more."
STDT 7059, How an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth is because the moon has less gravity then earth plus weight is a measure of force it needs an object to have gravity and mass    
STDT 7996, The gravitational force of the Earth and the Moon are different. This leads to the astronaut weighing less on the Moon than they do on Earth. 
STDT 7997, The reason why the astronaut's weight is different on the Moon is because there is less gravity on the Moon then on Earth.On Earth your mass will be the same on the Moon because mass does not change when gravity changes so your mass on the Earth will be the same on the Moon
STDT 8000," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the astronaut is farther away from earth (the gravitational force). Therefor his weight decreases (or changes). Example: The astronaut is on earth, he weighs 230 lbs. He goes to the moon- he goes farther away from the earth- and now weighs 34 lbs. "
STDT 8002," Earth is bigger than the moon, so the gravitational force is stronger on Earth. The astronauts weigh less on the moon because the moon is smaller and the gravitational force is less. "
STDT 8003, The gravitational pull on the moon is substantially less than it is on Earth. 
STDT 8004, Astronaut's weight is different on the moon then there is on earth because the gravitational pull is less on the moon then the amount of gravity there is on earth. 
STDT 8020, On the moon their is less gravity than on earth and when your closer to gravity you get hevier. 
STDT 8021, There is less gravity on the moon so the astronauts weight will decrease because when there's less gravity you will weigh less and if there's more gravity than you will weigh more. 
STDT 8025, it is different because of the gravitational interactions on the moon. They make your weight lighter.  
STDT 8027," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because it has less weight and mass, making its gravity weaker than the earth's. "
STDT 8032," Weight  is gravity pulled to the ground, Mass is the amount  of matter in the astronaut or object. There is not as much gravity on the moon there is on earth. Thats how it changed. "
STDT 8033, there is less gravity on the moon then earth 
STDT 5076," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon and earth are far away from each other. Since they are far from each other, their gravitational pull has decreased and people who go on the moon have different weights. "
STDT 8036,  Astronauts weight is less than it would be on the moon. Because are weight on the moon is less due to strength and mass                                                                                                                                                                                     st                                   han it would be on 
STDT 8040," A person's weight is based on the mass of the person and the gravitational force of a planet. So you may weigh  180 lb  on earth, but you may weigh less on the moon as the gravitational pull on the moon is weaker than on earth while your mass stays the same. "
STDT 8043,Because the moon is smaller is has less gravity and so the astronauts mass would not change but his weight would.
STDT 8045," The human weight on the moon is less than it would be on earth, due to how different the strength of gravity on the moon. The moon's gravitation force is caused by the mass and the size of the moon. This means that if an astronaut went to the moon, he would weigh less. Even though your mass would be the same as it would on earth. "
STDT 4043, weight depends on gravity and mass and the gravity is different on the earth because it pulls you down and the gravity on the moon pulls you up 
STDT 8050,       The gravity on the moon is less than the gravity on Earth.  That is why an astronaut weighs less on the moon.  The mass stays the same. 
STDT 8052, It is deffrent on the moon than on earth because of the mass and grafitational pull. 
STDT 8056, Well moons gravity is less then earths so it would affect your weight and your weight will decrease on the moon. 
STDT 8060, an astronauts wight is different on th moon because it is in space but because it is a small planet you can still jump on it. on earth we have gravity so we wont float like we do in space. 
STDT 8063," The reason why I think an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on the Earth is because on the moon there is less gravity than on the Earth, because if you jump on the moon you will jump higher than you would on Earth and if you throw a ball up it will take a while for it to come back down. "
STDT 8064, An astronauts weight is different on the moon then on Earth becsue there is no gravity in space. 
STDT 8066," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because there is less gravity on the moon, which leads to there not being enough pull to give much weight to the astronaut, unlike on earth where you have gravity to keep you on the ground, making you heavier, as all your mass if now holding you down.  "
STDT 8070, Since the moon is smaller compared  to earth the moon's gravitational pull is weaker than earth's gravitational pull. the moon's gravity level makes your weight lighter. On the moon your weight would be probably 16.5% you would experience on earth.
STDT 8072, The wight would decrease because there is more gravity on the moon then earth. 
STDT 8074," The earth's Moon has considerably less mass than the earth itself. Not only is the moon smaller than the earth, but it is only about 60 percent as dense as the earth. The gravitational attraction on the moon is much less than it is here on earth. "
STDT 8075," On earth you will probably weight more than in the moon. Why well its most likely that for example here you weight 134 and in the moon you will probably weight half your normal weight, because of the amount of gravitational pull here there is more pull than on the moon. On the moon everything is floating around !"
STDT 8079,A astronauts weight on the Moon is lees than it is on Earth because of the gravity on the moon being less than on Earth. The gravity on the moon is less than it is on Earth because of it's size. If it was bigger you would either way the same or more.
STDT 8082," The Earth is much more massive than the moon, so the astronaut's weight would be greater .Since the Moon is smaller than Earth, it has a weaker gravitational pull. In fact, the Moon only has 1/6 the gravity that Earth does. Because the  moon  is smaller  than  the  Earth  and about 60 percent as dense, the  astronaut's weight  is only about one-sixth  of  what it would be on. "
STDT 8083, because the gravitational force on the moon is less then on earth.
STDT 8084," Because of gravity,since earth's gravity is stronger than the moon's gravity, that means that there's more gravitational force pulling them to the ground, while since the moon has less gravitational force, that means that there is less of a pull compared to earth. "
STDT 8088, Their weight is different on the moon because there is no gravitational pull on there as there is when you are on Earth due to the mass and gravity pull on them.  
STDT 8089," For us our weight on the Moon is less than it would be on earth due to a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon. The moon's gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon. This means that if you went to the moon you weigh less, even though your mass stays the same. "
STDT 8090, The reason why the astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on the earth is because the moon has less mass than the earth. So the less mass means we can float and the more mass keeps us grounded.  
STDT 8096, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because on the moon there is less gravitational pull on the than on Earth therefore the astronaut weighs less on the moon then on Earth also the moon has less mass than  Earth. 
STDT 8099, Since weight is the force of gravity on an object  the weight of an object increases  with more gravity and decreases in a place with less.   
STDT 8102,the gravity affect  in weight    the gravity in the earth greater than the gravity  in the moon  
STDT 8104," because of gravity and mass, so your weight will change.  "
STDT 2967, The astronauts weight changes because weight depends on gravity and in space there's no gravity so it changes when they are in space and on earth because there's gravity and no gravity in space.
STDT 4099,The astronaut's weight would change considering there is 0 gravity on the moon. With that being said the astronaut would be way lighter on the moon than he would be on the earth.
STDT 8109," The earth has more mass than the moon, so the moon will have less gravity than earth. "
STDT 4111, The astronaut's weight is different because in space on the moon there is less gravity then on earth. 
STDT 8111, Weight is a measure of force. Your weight would decrease by a lot if there was no gravity. Weight is the force of gravity in an object. 
STDT 8112," It is different because, if the gravity force is strong you weigh a lot, if it's not that strong you, weigh less. "
STDT 8113, An astronaut's weight on the moon is different than it's weight on earth because the earth has more mass than the moon.  
STDT 8115, Because the moon is smaller than the earth so it has less gravitational pull 
STDT 8120," the moon has less mass, meaning its pull on you is less. "
STDT 8121, Because gravity is different on the moon than on earth and that will make your weight change. Another reason is your weight will change depending on where you are.  
STDT 8125, The reason the astronauts weight changes is because the moon has less gravity than the gravity on earth. 
STDT 8129,An astronaut's weight is different in on the moon  than on earth because there is gravity on earth and there is no gravity on the moon for example if you went to go weigh  yourself while floating the scale would probably say your 0 pounds this is because your are not standing on the scale. So your not putting weight or mass on the scale because your floating same thing in space. Another Reason is that on earth gravity is pushing you down onto  the ground but in space there is no gravity which means your weight is less
STDT 8132, Because the moons gravitational pull isn't as strong as the gravity from earth. 
STDT 8133, An astronauts weight is different on the moon then it is on Earth because the gravidity is much less than here on earth and if a person was on the moon they would weigh less than a person on earth would. The gravitational attraction is much less on the moon than it is in earth. 
STDT 8137,"The mass is different, our weight on the moon is less than it would be on Earth. This is because the strength of gravity on the moon. Your mass would stay the same on Earth and the moon but not your weight because of the gravitation force. "
STDT 8138," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because the moon has less mass than the earth, which means there is less gravity.  "
STDT 8143, The reason why an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth is because of gravity. The more gravity there is the more you weigh. Then the less gravity there is the less you weigh. 
STDT 8144," Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the gravitational field strength is much less. For example, on the moon astronauts can jump higher and leap farther than on earth you can't jump as high.The weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less gravity. "
STDT 8145," The astronaut is lighter in space because there is less gravity in space than on earth. the earth has a bigger mass hence, it has more gravity.  "
STDT 8147, An astronaut's weight would be less on the moon than on Earth because the gravitational force is less. Because the moon has less mass than Earth.  
STDT 8150, because the moon has less of a gravitational pull than earth 
STDT 8161,"  If you went to the moon you would weigh less, even though your mass stays the same. "
STDT 8162," On earth there is more gravity than on the moon, so the astronauts weight changes because weight changes depending on how much gravity the location you are in has. "
STDT 8164,"The astronaut's weigh on the moon is less than it would be on earth due to a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon. The moon's gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon. This means that if the astronaut went to the moon it would weigh less, even though it's mass stays the same. "
STDT 8165, It decreases because there is less gravity in the moon .
STDT 8168, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon has less gravity than the Earth. 
STDT 8171," Since the moon is a small planet and everything surrounding them is gravity the astrounat will have less pounds then on earth since earth is a big planet and it is perfect for life, the astrounat has more pounds. "
STDT 8173, the moon is smaller than the so the earth has a 60 percent dense than the moon dose. 
STDT 8176, Because the moons gravity does not pull you down  as hard as the earths gravity you weigh less. 
STDT 8180," The earth has more force (Luke, use the Gravitational Force) than the moon, so with the extra force on Earth, it has more pull on things and makes them heavier, while the moon has less pull and makes them lighter. "
STDT 8184," It's Different because there's no gravity on the moon, so lbs would turn into kg. "
STDT 8185, There is less gravitational force on the moon than there is on Earth.  The gravity on Earth is stronger than on the moon. 
STDT 8186,On Earth you have gravity and on the Moon you have less gravity. 
STDT 8206," The reason why an astronaut's weight would be different on the moon than on earth is because the moon's mass is less than earth's mass, so that means the gravity on the moon is lower which is why you would weigh less. "
STDT 6463," Yes, their weight and mass changed because the Moon does not have the same amount of mass as the Earth. Therefore, making the gravitational pull between them  less than what it would be on the moon. "
STDT 8207, the gavitational force is different 
STDT 8208, Its different because the gravity on the moon is less than it is on earth. 
STDT 8209, The astronunaut will weigh more on the earth because it has more mass and he will weigh less  on the moon because there is less mass. The moon is smaller.
STDT 8213," The weight of an object decreases on the moon because theres no gravity, and will increase on earth because of gravity. "
STDT 8215, Astronauts weight less on the moon is because there is a much less gravitational  pull  on earth there is a lot and your feet are pulling you down 
STDT 8219, It is different because the moon is so far away.  
STDT 8221, Astronauts weigh more on earth because there is more gravity than on the Moon. They weigh less on the Moon because there is less gravity than on Earth. 
STDT 8222," The astronaut's weight is different on the Moon than it is on Earth because there is less gravity on the Moon than there is on Earth. The more gravity, the weight of the astronaut will increase, and the less gravity the weight of the astronaut will decrease. "
STDT 8223, There weight is different because the moon is smaller than the earth so the moon has less gravity which makes you lighter but your mass stays the same
STDT 8225," The gravity of space,affects the human making them weight less and being able to jump high because of the gravity."
STDT 8229, The further you get from the earth the less gravitation force you have. 
STDT 8233, The astronaut weight will be different on the moon than the earth because there is less gravity on the moon.
STDT 8242," because there would be less gravity pulling down on you. Therefore, you would weigh less. "
STDT 8243," You weigh less because on the moon there is less gravity than on Earth. The moon is smaller, so it has less gravitational force pushing the astronaut down. "
STDT 8244, because the gravity is different on the moan  .     
STDT 8251,Because of the pull...mass...and weight
STDT 8252,An astronauts weight is different in the moon because depending on the location even if weight different we still have the same mas as earth location is only what matters.
STDT 8254, the moon has less gravity than the earth 
STDT 8256," The astronaut's weight changes when he goes to the moon because weight measures the gravity on an object with mass.  The less gravity there is, the less the object weighs.  There is a lot less gravity on the moon, so the astronaut's weight decreases. "
STDT 8258, because you weigh six times less on the moon than you do on earth. 
STDT 8259, Because there is less gravity on the moon than there is on Earth. 
STDT 8261, The weight of an object increases depending on the amount of gravity. And decreases where there is little gravity. The astronaut's weight decreases on the moon. 
STDT 1712," The astronaut weighs less on the moon than on earth, because on the moon there is less gravitational force. "
STDT 8265," On earth there is  a certain amount of gravity and when you're on the moon there is no gravity, so they weigh almost nothing.  "
STDT 8267, An astronaut weight is different on the Moon because there is less gravity on the Moon than on Earth.
STDT 8270," The moon's gravity is less than Earth's. So an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on Earth, but his or her mass remains the same. Also, on earth we have gravity so we can walk without floating. On the moon we have no gravity so we can float everywhere."
STDT 8273, The reason why is because anything on the moon is less weight . 
STDT 8276," Our weight on the moon is less than it would be on earth due to a difference on the strength of gravity on the moon.The moon's gravitation force is determained by the mass and the size of the moon.This means that if went to the moon,you would weigh less,even though your mass would stay the same. "
STDT 8277," On Earth, there is more gravity, resulting in an astronauts weight being heavier, while on the moon, there's less gravity, so the astronaut weighs less "
STDT 8278," Earth has more gravity than the moon, so you have less weight on the moon but still have the same mass. "
STDT 8279," Weight is defined by overall fore pushing down on an object because of gravity and how much mass it has. Because of the fact there is less gravity on the moon than earth, you will weigh less on the moon than on earth.   "
STDT 8280," it is very different when an astronaut is on earth than in space because the weight is different because there is gravity on earth, but on the moon there is no gravity. So it makes the weight of the person or the astronaut weaker"
STDT 8286," An astronaut´s weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because how weight depends on mass and gravity, the weight of an object increases with the location of        more gravity, and decreases with less gravity."
STDT 8287," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because on the moon, the Gravity is low but on earth its normal. "
STDT 8291, It is different because an object increases in an location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less gravity.
STDT 8292, It is different because everything is light on the moon.ðŸ˜Ž 
STDT 559," An astronaut's weight is different in space because without any gravity, you'd have no weight at all. After all, your weight is basically gravity pulling you down more. "
STDT 8295, The earth's gravity is much stronger than the moon's gravity. Weight is determined by mass and gravity. 
STDT 567, A large object and a small object combined will have more than two small object combied. 
STDT 8298,An astronauts weight is different in the moon because the too objects that are bigger and smaller proportion their mass so a large object and a small object  combined will have more pull than two small object combined. 
STDT 8301, An astronauts weight is different because the gravity is different on the moon as opposed to the earth 
STDT 8302, Astronauts weight is different on the moon because there is no gravity on the moon. 
STDT 8306," Some planets (or other surfaces) have different gravity depending on the size of the planet, so on Jupiter I can easily imagine you would be glued to the ground. :) "
STDT 8307, On the moon the gravitational pull is much weaker than Earth. 
STDT 8308," The moon's gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon.  Since the moon has significantly less mass than the Earth, it will not pull objects toward itself at the strength that Earth will . This means that if you went to the moon you would weigh less, even though your mass stays the same! "
STDT 8309," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because on Earth, his or hers mass is weighed in pounds, but on the moon, it is weighed in kilograms or newtons. For example, let's say the astronaut weighs 155 pounds (70.31 kg). On the moon, he or she would weigh 70.31 kilograms. It is like this because gravity changes your weight. You would not look different from what you look like, you would just weigh differently.    "
STDT 8310," Astronauts weight changes by how much gravitational force is in there location. For example the Earth has a lot of gravitational force so an astronauts weight is higher than it would be on the moon, and the mass would be lower."
STDT 8311," The astronaut's weight is different on earth than on the moon because, on Earth the gravitational pull is stronger than on the moon and weight is how much you are being pulled to the ground by gravitational pull so on the moon you will weigh less than on earth. "
STDT 8312, The astronaut's weight is lower because of the moon having less mass then the earth. 
STDT 8318, If I were an astronaut on another planet that is smaller in mass than the Earth I would weigh less because weight is determined by the force of gravity on an object. Gravity is determined by the mass of an object and a planet smaller than earth with less mass would have less gravity. 
STDT 8323,There is no gravity to pull the weight
STDT 8325, When an astronaut is on earth he/she/they would gain more weight because of the pull of gravity from a big planet.  
STDT 4353, A weaker gravity pull. The moon's gravity is different than the earth's gravitational pull. 
STDT 8327, our weight on the moon is less than our weight on the earth because theres less gravatational pull. 
STDT 8330, There is no gravity on the moon.  
STDT 8332," Astronaut's weight on the moon is less than it would be on Earth due to gravity on the moon. The moon's gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon. This means that if you went to the moon you would weigh less, even though your mass stays the same! "
STDT 8333, The difference is that my weight will be different but my mass will stay the same. 
STDT 8335, The weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the gravitational pull on the moon is much weaker than here on Earth. On the moon the astronaut is lighter.  
STDT 8338, Distance stays the same. So it is not a factor. Since the moon has smaller mass an astronaut's weight will be much less. 
STDT 8340,An astronaut weight is different on the moon than on Earth because the gravitational  force is greater on Earth than on the moon.  
STDT 8463," The Earth has more gravity than the moon, and weight is based off the force of gravity, so if the astronaut going to space weighed 130lbs on earth, they would weigh less on the moon because the moon has less gravity than the earth does. "
STDT 8464, because of gravity. 
STDT 8466, the astronaut will weight differently on the moon because the moon has no gravity and has a less mass and it affects the weight of the astronaut 
STDT 8471,An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because the moon is smaller than the Earth. The astronaut would weigh less on the moon because the moon is smaller and more on the Earth because the Earth is larger. The larger the planet the more a person weighs. The smaller the planet the less gravitational pull that it has. 
STDT 8474," The Earth has more mass than the Moon, which means it also has more gravity than the Moon. Because a person's weight is determined by gravitational force, a person would weigh more on Earth than on the Moon, but their mass would remain the same. "
STDT 8475," The reason why an astronaut's weight is different than it is on the moon than it is on the earth is because weight is a measure of force. On earth, your mass is measured in three categories, those being: kilograms, pounds and newtons. Weight can change by location, and in this case our location is the moon. for the astronauts weight on earth, let's say they weigh about 180 pounds on earth , they would weigh 30 pounds on the moon! This is because of the weight of the object That is the moon, in this case, has leg weight so with that, the gravity decreases because of it. that why the astronaut's weight is different from earth then on the moon.  "
STDT 8484," The earth is a lot stronger than gravity, whereas the moon is not. So we are lighter on the moon due to gravity pulling on the moon whenever we are on it. And so that makes the gravity weaker. "
STDT 8487, an astronaut's weight is different because there is no gravity on the moon and there is gravity on earth 
STDT 8489,in space there is not as much gravity as earth so the way it inpacks is how much you weigh so you can weigh 300 pounds on earth but when you get to moon you can weigh 150. 
STDT 8490, The moon is smaller than earth so it has a smaller gravitational pull so you weigh less. 
STDT 8491, I think it's mostly gravity but it could be mass because the astronauts weight changes a lot when there on the moon
STDT 8495, Since the moon is smaller than the earth it has a weaker gravitational pull the moon only has about 1/4 the gravity that earth does that mean you can weigh six timeless on the moon than you do on earth  
STDT 8497, an astronauts weight is different on the moon than on the earth because on the earth theres less gravity so you weight heavier than when your on  the moon  the gravity  increases so you weight lighter. 
STDT 8499," Because the weight is a measure of force, it requires an object to have both mass and gravity.Also, a person weighs less on the moon. "
STDT 7606, An astronaut would weigh less on the moon but on earth he would weigh more because of gravity. 
STDT 2980," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth, because weight is the force of gravity on an object. So, on Earth with more gravity the weight of the astronaut increases but on the moon since there's less gravity the weight of the astronaut decreases. "
STDT 8503," The moon's gravity is less than on earth, An astronaut weighs less on the moon than on earth because his weight decreases because there is no gravitational pull. "
STDT 8505, They measure weight in kilograms and there is no gravitational pull making the seem lighter than the actually are. 
STDT 8506, An Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the Earth because of the strength of gravity.  The gravity on the moon is determined by mass which is much lower. 
STDT 8510, The astronaut on the moon has less gravitational force than on earth so that means his weight will be lighter on the moon and heavier on earth. 
STDT 8515, the surface gravity of an astronaut or other objects is the gravitational acceleration experienced at its surface.
STDT 8518," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because the moon is smaller than Earth. Therefore, the gravitational force is less on the moon. Additionally the moon has less mass than Earth, so the gravity on the moon is less than on Earth. "
STDT 8523," Weight is a measure of force that needs mass and gravity.The moon does not have  as much gravity as earth so you will weight but will be lighter than on earth.An example is, on earth you would weigh 175 lbs on the moon you would weigh 29 lbs."
STDT 8525, Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the earth is because the gravity is different. 
STDT 8526, The astronaut's weight is less on the moon because there is less gravity on the moon than on earth.  
STDT 8527, There is less gravity on the moon than on Earth. You may weight more on earth than you would on the moon. 
STDT 8528," ""‹""‹""‹""‹""‹""‹The gravity affects their weight on the moon because there is a less gravitational pull than on Earth. "
STDT 8530," It would affect my weight because weight is measured by force. Weight is the force of gravity. So the more something.  Gravity the more a person will weigh. As an astronaut, I will weigh less because it is on a planet with a larger mass than the earth . "
STDT 8532," The reason why the weight is different on the moon is because the moon has 0 gravity, unlike the earth which has gravity.   "
STDT 8540," the mass of an astronauts changes when they are on the moon because their is no gravity ,rather than on earth their is gravity that effects the mass on the astronaut"
STDT 8541," A n astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth, because the moon is smaller which means that the gravitational force is less. That's why the  astronaut's weight is different on the moon. "
STDT 8545, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than then earth because earth has gravity but the moon does not. 
STDT 8547, there weight is different because in space it is zero gravity so they weight less but in earth there is gravity so you weight more
STDT 8548,On Earth there  is more  gravity so you will weigh more than on the moon where  there is less gravity. 
STDT 8549," Since the earth has more gravity than the moon, it has a bigger gravitational pull, causing their weight to increase. But, their mass would stay the same and they would weigh less on the moon. "
STDT 8550, The weight is different because the gravity on the moon is different then the one on earth.
STDT 8552, Its because weight is a measure of force it has to have an object to have both mass and gravity. 
STDT 8553, Weight increases in places with more gravity and decreases in places with less gravity. 
STDT 8559, A astronaut weight is different on the moon because in the earth we have gravity pullings us and the astronaut weight does not have gravity so they just float around.
STDT 8563, The weight of an astronaut is different on Earth then it is on the moon because the weight of a object increases were there is more gravity and decreases in a place with less gravity and because the moon has less gravity the astronanut weights less. The Earth has more gravity so on Earth the astronaut weight more.
STDT 8565,Because there is not a lot of gravity on the moon the weight of the object or person drops.
STDT 8567, In space it no gravity but on earth we got gravity. 
STDT 8571," Because the earth has more mass than the moon, therefore you have less weight on the moon than on earth. "
STDT 8574,it is different because there is less gravitational pull in space than on earth so that is why you weigh less in space than on earth.
STDT 8577, Because they depend on the gravity & the mass.
STDT 8580, the gravitational pull on the moon is not as strong as on the earth.
STDT 8581, The reason astronauts weigh more here than on the moon is because the moon's gravitation is weaker than here on Earth. 
STDT 8584, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on the earth because there is less gravitational pull. 
STDT 8585," Astronaut's weight is different on earth because astronaut have gravity pulling on them so place that have more gravity pulling on them, they have more weight, but place like moons' astronaut have less weight. "
STDT 8586," On the Moon, there is less gravity, which means the lower gravity you have, the lower weight you have on the moon.  "
STDT 8587," Since the moon has less mass than Earth, it will not pull objects towards itself at the strength that Earth will. The moon doesn't have the gravity the Earth does. "
STDT 8590, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on the Earth because the moon is smaller than the Earth and so the gravitational force on the moon is not as strong as it is on Earth. 
STDT 8592, An astronauts weight on the moon would be different because the moon has less gravity than the earth. 
STDT 8595, Because there's less gravity on the moon than earth
STDT 8599, On the moon you weigh less since the moon has less of a gravitational pull than Earth does   
STDT 8601," Your weight on the Moon is lower than your weight on Earth, because the moon has less gravity. The more gravity there is in a surrounding, the more you weigh because of gravity's pull. Even though your weight is different on planets other than Earth, you're mass stays the same. "
STDT 901," The moon has a different location than the earth, on the moon, an astronaut is weighed by mass and on earth, an astronaut is weighed by lbs and mass. The earth has a greater gravitational force. The moon's distance is farther away from the gravitational force.  "
STDT 8606, on earth an astronaut may weigh 120 lbs on the moon the same astronaut might weigh 20 lbs because of the mass and size  of the moon that means if you went to the moon you would weigh less even though your mass would stay the same. 
STDT 4684," An astronaut's weight will be different on the moon because there is no gravity and on earth the gravitational force is different, so you will weigh more on earth than on the moon. "
STDT 8619," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than the earth because. The weight and the force, it weights lesser on the moon than the earth, that's why we can't jump high on the earth, cause of the weight and the force keeping us to stay on the ground. "
STDT 8626, The weight is lower on the moon because it has a lower gravitational pull. 
STDT 8631, becase on the moon it has less gravity and on eath has more gravity 
STDT 937, Because the Earth contains more mass than the moon and also has a greater gravitational force. This means the Astronaut weighs less on the moon than when he is on Earth. 
STDT 8633, A human need's mass and gravity because weight depends on it. 
STDT 8639," An astronaut's wight would be different on the moon than on the Earth because the moon has less mass than the Earth, therefore it has less gravity and the astronaut would weigh less."
STDT 8640,"On earth there is gravity, In the moon there is less gravity. That means that in earth we will weight more because there is more gravity than in the moon."
STDT 8641, An astronaut weighs less on the moon  than on earth because the moon has no gravity like earth  
STDT 8643, A astronuat has very little gravity on the moon   
STDT 8648, When astronauts are on the moon their weight decrease to 0 and the mass stays the same. Weight increases with places with more gravity and decrease in places with less. 
STDT 8651," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because, there is less gravity on the moon than on earth. Which in effect causes his/her body weight to change. "
STDT 8653, Because there is less gravity on the moon than on earth. 
STDT 8657," Well this one is obvious, an astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on the Earth because of gravity. "
STDT 8658," The weight would be different because of the less gravitational pull, making weight seem lighter than on earth where the gravitational pull is stronger. "
STDT 8661," Earth's gravitational pull is much stronger than the moon's. So, we weigh less on the moon than we would on Earth. "
STDT 8663, the weight changes because of how much mass the moon has compared to the earth. so the moon has less mass and gravity because it is smaller and the earth has more mass and gravity because it is bigger.  
STDT 8664, The weight of an astronaut will change on the moon getting lighter because there is less gravity on the moon than on Earth.Weight is affected by gravity. 
STDT 8666, the gravitational pull isn't as strong on the moon there for you weigh less but your mass is the same 
STDT 8670," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because of this. Weight is the force of gravity on an object. The weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. The moon's gravity is less than Earth's. So an astronaut weighs not as much on the moon as on Earth, but their mass remains the same. "
STDT 8671," Because, the Earth has gravity, the Moon doesn't. "
STDT 8673, This is due to the fact that the moon's mass is less than Earth's and because of that the moon has less of a gravitational pull on us. 
STDT 8675," The astronaut's weight would be different on the moon than on earth because the moon has a weaker gravitationally pull. Weight is just the amount of how much gravity is pulling down on an object, so if the moon's gravitationally pull is less than on earth than the astronaut would weigh less than on the moon.  "
STDT 8677, The astronauts weight is different on the moon because the moon has less gravity than earth 
STDT 8686,"           An astronaut has a greater weight on Earth than in space because of gravity. Gravity is the force on a person or object that is caused by gravity and mass. Because of this, weight increases when there is more gravity. When there is less gravity, the weight decreases. Since there is no gravity in space, the astronaut is lighter in space than when he or she is on Earth. "
STDT 8689, An astronauts weight is different on the moon because weight is a measure of force so you need to have an object that has mass and gravity 
STDT 8690, there's not as much gravity in space.
STDT 8691,The weight of the astronaut changes on the moon because gravity on the moon is not the same as on earth. Weight depends on gravity. The mass of the astronaut stayed the same because mass depends on matter. Matter is what you are made up of. 
STDT 8692, because weight depends upon gravity and mass but gravity on earth differs from gravity on moon 
STDT 8697, A astronauts weight is different on the moon because the moon has lesser gravity then earth 
STDT 8699," In my own words, I say the mass has nothing to do with it. I think that is the amount of gravity that the earth has, since the earth is bigger than the moon, so the gravitational force is different.  "
STDT 8700, The reason why astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth is because the weight of the astronaut increase in location with more gravity like the Earth. And decrease in places with less gravity like the moon.   
STDT 8702," Two factors of the gravitational force between two objects are distance and mass. Earth has a much larger mass than the moon, thus it has a stronger gravitational pull over other objects. Weight is the force on an object based on mass andgravity, so the stronger the force, the greater the weight. As a result of the weaker gravitational force objects experience on the moon, an astronaut would weigh less on the moon, where gravity is weak, than on earth, where gravity is stronger. "
STDT 8704, On earth there is more gravitational force and on the moon there is less gravitational force. That means that the astronauts will be lighter on the moon then on earth. 
STDT 8707, An astronaut's weight changes on the moon because the mass of the moon is much less than the Earth mass.
STDT 8815," because, depending on where you are, your weight will change. The reason I came up with that answer is because of how much gravity there is at the place you are. "
STDT 8822, an astrounots weight is diffrent from earth because in earth you are heavier and in space you are lighter because on earth there is gravity and in space there is no gravity 
STDT 8825, A austronauts weight is diffrent because on earth there is gravity and gravity is when it pushes you down if we didnt have gravity we will be floating in the air right now but were not because of gravity and in space there is no gravity so thats why people float in space an there 
STDT 8827," Because the Earth has more mass than the Moon, the Earth has more gravity and the astronaut weighs more on earth than on the moon. "
STDT 8829, The astronaut's weight is different on Earth than on the moon due to gravity. 
STDT 8830, An astronaut's weight is different on Earth than on the Moon because on Earth we have gravity and the Moon doesn't. 
STDT 8831, The weight on the moon is different from earth because the gravitational force is weaker because the moon is smaller. 
STDT 8835, The astronauts weight is different on the Moon bc there is less of a gravitational attraction on the Moon the on Earth 
STDT 8838, there is not as much gravity on the moon as there is on earth meaning you are lighter on the moon than on the earth. 
STDT 8849, Because there is no Gravity on the moon as there is on earth and because of that while on earth the gravity pull you down and you'll have weight 
STDT 8850, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the gravitational pull is different.  Weight is a measure of force of an object's mass and gravity.   
STDT 8852,  The reason why an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth is because weight is a measure of force. You must have gravity and mass to keep your weight.  
STDT 8858, On the moon a astronaut's would weigh on like 29 pounds but on earth a astronaut's would maybe weigh 175 pounds. 
STDT 8862, The body weight on Earth is greater than the weight on the moon because of gravity.  Our body weight is more on Earth than on the moon because the force of gravity is higher on Earth. 
STDT 8863, da moon has less gravity than earth. 
STDT 8870," Because Earths Gravity is stronger than The Moons Gravity ; therefore the astronauts weight is (Examples) is 134 on Earth, but on the astronauts weight is 30 on the moon . That also means that gravitational pull between the Earth and Moon is different, that also means that the volume of astronauts is greater on Earth than on the moon. "
STDT 8877, The astronauts weight is different on the moon then on earth because there is no gravity on the moon so u weigh like nothing but when you are on earth u weigh a lot more  
STDT 8885," Astronauts' weight is different on the moon than it is on the earth because the earth has greater gravitational forces than the moon does. Therefore, making astronauts able to float and move more lightly.   "
STDT 8887, Because earth has more gravity  
STDT 8890, Because there is zero gravity in space but there is gravity on earth. 
STDT 8892," Since the Moons mass is smaller than Earths mass, there is less gravitational pull between the astronaut and the Moon, on Earth there is a stronger gravitational pull because Earths mass is larger than the Moons mass. "
STDT 8896, Our weight is less on the moon than on the Earth because the strength of gravity on the moon is different.  It's determined by the mass and size of the moon. 
STDT 8904, bcuase the moon has less gravity then earth that is why you can jump higher on the moon 
STDT 8907, Astronaut's weight if different on the moon than on earth because the gravitational pull decreased when being in space.  
STDT 8909, The reason why astronauts are lighter on the moon is because the gravitational pull on the moon is low 
STDT 8910, The reason an astronaut weighs more on Earth than he does on the moon is because the moon has less gravity than Earth. 
STDT 8911," There is more gravity on earth than there is on the moon, so the astronaut would weigh more on the earth. "
STDT 8913, The gravity on the moon is less than the gravity on earth. Which means someone who weighs 175 on earth will weigh 29 on the moon but the mass of the person will stay the same at 79KG 
STDT 8916, Because the moon's gravity is lower so your weight would decrease.  
STDT 8924," Astronauts' weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because weight depends on both mass and gravity. There is no gravity on the moon, so astronauts would weigh less on the moon than Earth.  "
STDT 8930, Less gravity so nothing is pulling you so you are lighter because the moon has a smaller mass than the earth. Ex. You can not pick up a car on earth but you can on the moon. 
STDT 8934, there is less gravity in space there for causing  him or her to wight less. 
STDT 8935," because there's no gravity on the moon but there is on earth, so it causes astronauts to float and jump high. "
STDT 8936," They would weight the same but there is less gravity on the moon. On earth, the gravitational force is stronger than on the moon "
STDT 8945, Astronaut weighs more on Earth because Earth has more mass than the moon. The gravitational force is more on Earth because Earth has a lot more mass which makes the gravitational force stronger. The moon has less mass so the gravitational force is less making us weigh less.  
STDT 8948, The reason an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth is because the moon's gravity is weaker than earths. 
STDT 8950, Because the mass of the person or astronaut is less on the moon then it is on earth.
STDT 8953, Earth has an atmosphere that creates gravity and on the moon there is no atmosphere and that equals no gravity. 
STDT 8954, the difference is because their on different planets one is on the moon and other on earth and they have very different gravitational pulls on different  planets i think. 
STDT 8960, The astronauts weight on the moon is different because their is less gravity on the moon the on earth.( I feels like gods foot pushing you down) 
STDT 8961, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because the moon has less mass and gravity than earth and how heavy the astronaut is on earth ( he/she/they) will be lighter than on earth 
STDT 8963, The reason why astronauts are lighter on the moon than Earth is because the Earth has more gravity than the  moon. 
STDT 8967, An astronaut's weight in different on the moon than it on earth because in space there is no gravity  
STDT 8974, Yes because when you're in space your weight changes due to lack of air and gravity. 
STDT 8975,"  An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the Earth because the weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. like for example, the moon's gravity is less than Earth's. So an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on Earth, but his or her mass remains the same. "
STDT 8976, because there is not much gravity on the moon than on earth . So that why the weight is different.  
STDT 8977,"   Mass refers to the amount of matter that is in an object, but weight is the force experienced by an object due to the cause of gravity. Since weight depends on both mass and gravity, it changes depending on the location. Let's look at astronauts as an example. On Earth, an astronaut may weigh around 175 pounds (778 N). But on the moon, the same astronaut would weigh only 29 pounds (129 N)! which is a big diffrence "
STDT 8749, our weight on the moon would be less than it would be on earth due to a difference of the strength of the gravity on the moon. 
STDT 8984," The reason why an astronaut weighs less on the moon is because space does not have gravity. Earth does have gravity. What gravity does is pull you down and keeps you from flouting away. So, if gravity pushes you down to stay on Earth, then doesn "
STDT 8987," Because the moon's gravitational pull towards the astronaut is weaker than it would be on the earth. He still has the same mass, but technically weighs less due to weight being measured by how much an object is pulled down by gravity "
STDT 8989," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth, is because the gravitational pull is smaller on the moon than on the earth. "
STDT 8992," It is different because when you're on earth, you have your exact correct weight. But, when you're on the moon, your weight is lighter because of the gravity. "
STDT 8997, there weight is different because on the moon there is barely any gravity and on earth there is a lot of gravity  
STDT 5179," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth, because the moon has less gravity than the Earth. This is why astronauts walk slower on the moon. "
STDT 8999," Weight is the force of gravity on an object. The weight of an object or person on earth is different than its weight on the moon because of the difference in gravitational force. In this case, an astronaut would weigh less on the moon than on earth. "
STDT 9001, It is different because the moons mass is a lot less than the earth's mass. 
STDT 9002," The two factors that affect gravitational force are distance and mass. The larger the mass, the stronger the gravitational forces. The moon is smaller than the Earth therefore the weaker gravitational force it has compared to Earth.The astronaut's weight is lesser due to the weaker gravity. "
STDT 9003," The weight of an astronaut changes when his location changes, because the weight is affected by gravity. The gravity in the Earth and the Moon are different so his weight will be different. His weight on the Moon will be less that on Earth because there is less gravity in the Moon. The mass of the astronaut stays the same.  "
STDT 9006," The moon has less gravitational pull, so the weight is less "
STDT 9007, The gravitational force is greater on earth because of its greater mass. 
STDT 9009,"  The moon does not have as much of a gravitational force as the earth does, so when astronauts are on the moon they float because of the gravity change.  "
STDT 9010," because the moon is smaller than the earth and almost 60 percent as dense, the atronauts weight is one sixth of what it would be on earth. "
STDT 9011, An astronaut's weights is different on the moon because of gravity. 
STDT 9012," The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon has less gravity than Earth. The more gravity, the more you weigh. The less gravity, the less you weigh. "
STDT 1432, an astronauts weight would be different of the moon than on the earth because the moon has less mass than the earth.   
STDT 9013, An astronauts weight is different in the Earth than the Moon because the weight on earth is measured in pounds or newtons.  Weigh also changed when there less gravity like the moon. 
STDT 9015, On Earth our body is heavier because Earth is full of gravity and on the moon our body is so much lighter because in outer space there is no gravity. 
STDT 9016, The moon is smaller than earth so it has smaller mass. So the smaller somthing is usually means less gravity causeing you on the moon when you jump to actually go higher than if you would on earth. 
STDT 9019," The moon has less gravity and the earth has more gravity. Because on earth we can run and walk without floating, but on the moon we float.  "
STDT 9022," The weight is different because there is no gravity in space. Let's say I weigh 132 pounds. Then, if I went to the moon, I would weigh about 21.91 pounds. So our weight changes when there is no gravity.     "
STDT 9024, an astronaut's weight is different on the moon because of gravitational force. his mass will stay the same because gravity has no effect on mass. his weight will be a lot less on the moon because there is no gravity on the moon.    
STDT 9025," My weight would be heavier because there is greater mass, therefore greater gravitational pull.  "
STDT 9026," because there is less gravity on the moon than earth, so their weight size is smaller. "
STDT 9027," The Earth has more mass than the moon does, so the gravity is more on earth and less on the moon, which makes the astronaut heavier on earth rather than the moon.  "
STDT 9028," The Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth, because on the moon objects weigh less, because of their gravitational pole.  "
STDT 9031, An astronaut will weigh less because the moon is smaller than the earth and has less gravitational pull. 
STDT 9034," Yes, their weight did change because the moon is smaller and has less gravity. On the other hand, their mass steyed the same. "
STDT 9038, This is because the moon has less gravitational force.  
STDT 9039," Our weight on moon is less than it would be on Earth due to a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon. The moon's gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon. ... This means that if you went to the moon you would weigh less, even though your mass stays the same "
STDT 9041," Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on the Earth because, there is a different level/force of gravity on the moon.  "
STDT 9044, Because the gravity works different on the moon. 
STDT 9045, Because there is more mass on the Earth then on the moon 
STDT 9051, It is different because the moon has a different atmosphere.  
STDT 9053," The moon is smaller than earth, so it has a weaker gravitational pull, so you weigh six times less on the moon than on earth. "
STDT 9058, because the moons mass is less than the earths mass. 
STDT 9059, Since weight depends on both mass and gravity it changes depending on your location.   
STDT 9061, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the gravitational attraction on the Moon is less than the Earth's. Weight is a measure of force. Mass and gravity changes based on location. 
STDT 9065,  because there is no gravity on the moon and there is less weight on the moon and there is more weight on the earth 
STDT 9066," Why is an astronaut's weight different on the moon than it is on Earth? Well, because the Moon has less gravitational pull than Earth itself. Example; if you jumped right now, you wouldn't go so far up. But if you jumped on the Moon (with an Astronaut suit on so you don't suffocate), you would jump 5x higher (or higher)! "
STDT 9067," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the earth. The Earth has more mass, so it has more gravitational force than the moon, because the moon has less mass than Earth. "
STDT 9071, The astronaut's mass is less on the moon because of the lack of gravity. 
STDT 9073," On the moon there is less gravity. Therefore, someone or something will weigh less. But on earth there's more gravity, so there's more weight. "
STDT 9074," The moon has less mass than the earth.And the moon is smaller than the earth.Also,the gravitational attraction on the moon is much less than that on earth.  "
STDT 9076, It would affect the weight because 1 planet is heavier and one planet is lighter. 
STDT 9078," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because there is less gravity on the moon. If an astronaut weighs 135 pounds on earth, he would weigh less in space. A person's weight increases when there is more gravity, but that person's weight decreases when there is less gravity. So, when people go to the moon, they weigh less because there is less gravity. "
STDT 9079," The astronauts weigh differently on the moon than the earth because the moon has less mass than the earth, which means that it also has less of a gravitational force, so that is why the astronauts weight less on the moon than on the earth. "
STDT 9081, their weight is way lighter because there is not nearly as much on the moon. 
STDT 9082, it has no gravity 
STDT 4577," Objects on the Moon weigh less than they do on the Earth  because the gravitational field strength is much less . On the Moon, astronauts can jump higher and leap farther than on Earth. For a given gravitational field strength, the greater the mass of the object, the greater its weight. "
STDT 9091," Weight is just a way to show the force of gravity experienced on an object, so the less gravity the less you weigh.    "
STDT 4166, The reason why the astronauts'  is different on the moon is because there is no gravitational force to keep them on the ground like earth dose. 
STDT 9099, because there is no gravity in space 
STDT 9100," The moon's mass is less than the earth's mass, so it will pull on the astronaut less. Which causes the weight of the astronaut to be less than his/her weight on earth. "
STDT 9102, on the moon there is no gravity when your standing on it. in space there is no gravity so in space its easier to carry someone bc in space there is no gravity so you cant feel there weight. on earth there is gravity so since theres gravity there nothing that can pull you up from the ground so since there gravity in earth when you try to pick someone up its harder. 
STDT 1136," When astronauts go to space, the gravity push more on their body more than on earth. This why their weight changes. "
STDT 9103," The weight will change because there's less gravity on the moon and the less gravity there is, the less weight, but the more gravity the more weight. "
STDT 9106," The further you go, the less gravity there is and the earth has gravity that keeps your weight down and in the air. "
STDT 9109," An astronauts weight is different on the moon then it is on earth because,the weight of the astronaut will change but the mass will always remain the same. "
STDT 9110," The astronauts weight would be less than it would be on earth because of the strength of gravity that's on the moon. The moon's gravity is shown by the mas and size of the moon.That means that if you are able to go to the moon your weight would be different, but your mass would stay the same. "
STDT 9111, Weight is measured by the force of gravity and the moon is smaller than Earth. It has less gravitational force. The astronaut would weigh less on the Moon. 
STDT 9124, The astronaut weight is different because there is no gravity in space. 
STDT 9126, The weight of the astronaut decreases because space has less gravity than earth. 
STDT 9130, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon has no gravity with no gravity it causes heavy things like humans to be lighter or light things like a pencil or cup to float. 
STDT 9133," I read that the earth is bigger than the moon, so you will have more weight on earth because it is bigger, but on the moon you will have less weight because it is smaller. The reason why you have more weight on earth than the moon is because of gravity. "
STDT 9135, On the moon there is less gravity than on earth. The more gravity the more mass. 
STDT 9140, The mass stays the same but the weight changes because the amount of gravity changes. 
STDT 9144," An astronaut's weight is lighter because there is less gravity in space, which makes him or her float. The weight of a person or thing expands in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less gravity.People weigh more on earth than we do in space.     "
STDT 9145," Astronauts weigh less on the Moon because they are much lighter and there is a weaker gravitational pull    than there is on Earth. There is no gravity on the moon, which makes you lighter. There  is gravity o earth which makes you heavier.   "
STDT 9157, the moon is smaller then the earth and about 60 %  as dense because the gravitational field strength is much less 
STDT 9168, an astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is the earth because theres less gravity on the moon then there is the earth  
STDT 9171," The astronauts weight will be lowered although, the mass of the astronaut would stay the same "
STDT 9178," Mass would depend on the object's matter in that object and weight would be the force that is experienced by gravity on that object. So, on the moon, an astronaut would weigh less than on earth because the weight of the astronaut would depend on both mass and gravity and the location the astronaut is at. "
STDT 9179, Since there is less gravity on the moon than there is on earth and weight is experienced because of gravity the astronaut would weigh very little on the moon but weigh much more on earth. This is because the moon has less mass than the Earth. 
STDT 9181," On earth there is gravity and up in space there is not, so an astronaut's weight is going to be different up in space and on earth because gravity is pulling yo don't mean while in space The body is more ""lifted"". "
STDT 9183, His weight is less on the moon because there is less gravity 
STDT 7300, Because of the no gravity in space which affects the moon. 
STDT 9186," Since weight depends on both mass and gravity, it changes depending on location. An Astronauts's weight on moon is less than it would be on earth due to a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon. The moon's gravitational force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon so when the Astronaut goes to the moon they would weigh less, even though their mass stays the same. "
STDT 9187, The gravity on the moon is weaker than earth's gravity.There'sfor the weight of an astronaut is 29 Ibs. 
STDT 9190, The amount of mass on the moon wouldn't be able to pull the astronauts weight too itself the moons mass wouldn't be enough. (the moon has less mass than the earth therefor it wouldn't be the same on the moon than it is on the earth so the astronaut would weigh less on the moon than the earth.) 
STDT 9191," The astronaut's weight changed on the moon because the astronaut had less gravitational force.  Therefore, he weighted less while on the moon.    "
STDT 9192," Because the moon is smaller than earth that means there is a weaker gravitational pull. The moon is 6 times smaller than the earth, so that means you weigh 6 times less than you do on earth.  "
STDT 9194," The astronauts weight is different on the moon because the moon's gravitation is determined by the mass, and he size o the moon so that's why the moon changes your weight to be lighter. "
STDT 9196, because  weight is the force that is caused by gravity so because weight depends on gravity and mass and that would depend on the location that the astronauts are in. 
STDT 9199, its because the gravitational attraction on the moon is not the same as on earth so they weigh less 
STDT 9202," because the moon has less mass than earth so that would mean that it wont have the same gravitational pull and mass like earth will, so it would mean if you went to the moon your weight would decrease due to the mass the moon has compared to earth itself, the moons gravitation force is determined by the mass and size of it. "
STDT 9205, The moon has a smaller mass than the earth and therefore less gravitational pull. 
STDT 9206, since the Moon is more smaller than the Earth it has a weaker gravitational pull and the moon has only 1\6 the gravity the Earth  does that means you weigh  6 ( x ) less on the Moon then you on the Earth. on Earth  gravity is the constant force pulling us towards Earth and preventing us from flying off into space like a ballon for inctence when u step on a scale it shows ur weight as a number this number that u see is actually a measurement of the gravitational pull that Earth has to you  
STDT 9207, Because the moon's gravity is less than that on earth therefore you would weigh less on the moon.  
STDT 9209," because Earth is bigger, it has a stronger pull. "
STDT 9210," The moon's force is less than Earth's. Then an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on Earth, but his or her mass rests the same. "
STDT 9216, The moon is smaller than the earth and it has a smaller mass. 
STDT 9218, when walking on the moon its light weight  
STDT 9219," Objects on the Moon weigh less than they do on the Earth  because the gravitational field strength is much less . On the Moon, astronauts can jump higher and leap farther than on Earth. ... For a given gravitational field strength, the greater the mass of the object, the greater its weight. "
STDT 9223," Well the mass of the astronaut decreases on the moon since there is less gravity.Comared to on earth, there is a lot more gravity so the astronaut has greater mass.  "
STDT 9227," The weight is a measure of force. The object has to have mass and gravity. Here on earth your most likely weighed in pounds (lb) and since you have to have mass and gravity and there is not much gravity on the moon, if I were to weigh myself I would be about five pounds, or weigh nothing. "
STDT 938, The weight difference is a lot because there is less gravity on the moon than on earth because the mass of the moon is less 
STDT 9236, The gravity on earth is higher than the gravity on the moon.   
STDT 9239," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth, because Earth's mass is larger than the moon's mass, so Earth will have a stronger gravitational pull than the moon. "
STDT 9243, Since weight is a measure of force and also requires both mass and gravity depending on the location.  The weight of the astronaut increases in a location with more gravity such as the moon.  When the astronaut is on Earth the gravity is more.  The mass of the astronaut will stay the same but the weight depends on the location.  The astronaut that could weight 200 or so on Earth would weigh less on the moon.  
STDT 9244," The reason an astronaut  weight is different on the moon the earth is because weight changes depending on the location, and since weight is a force of gravity.  So each object with  weight decreases  depending on each location we go to. So the reason why the weight of an astronaut's weight changes id because of the gravity and the reason why is that the moon has less gravity the earth does, but the mass stay the same "
STDT 9246, An astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth becuase of the gravitation. 
STDT 9247, The weight isn't actually decreased the moons low gravity just makes them lighter than normal because the gravity lifts them a little because its so low on gravity witch means the gravitational pull is weaker. Because it less of a mass than Earth so it doesn't have as much of a pull so it makes you seem light.Some astronauts have a hard time walking again because there not used to the regular pull. 
STDT 9249," There can't be weight in space due to there being no gravity on the moon. While on earth, gravity keeps things steady, like for an example, there's weight mostly on earth because of gravity.  "
STDT 5159, It's different because that's because weight is a measure of force. It is both mass and gravity. 
STDT 9259," The moon has low gravity, since the astronaut is in that location, he gets low gravity. "
STDT 9263, It is different because the moon has less gravity than what's on earth.  This means you are approximately 6x less than your average weight. Causing gravity on earth to pull you down and on the moon pulls you up. 
STDT 9267, the mass of the moon is less then the earth and the atmosphere is different.  
STDT 9268, the moon has less gravity because it is smaller than earth 
STDT 9274, There is less gravity on the moon that means they have less strain and can jump higher this is because the moon is smaller than the earth the astronaght would weigh less on the moon. 
STDT 9276, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the Earth because there is little gravity on the moon. 
STDT 9277," Gravitational force affects your weight, so if you were to go to the moon your mass would stay the same, but your weight would decrease since there isn't a gravitational force on the moon "
STDT 9281, The astronaut's weight on the moon is different from earth because the gravitational field on the moon has less strength. The moon actually has 1/6 the gravity than earth does and that is why you can jump higher on the moon as well.  
STDT 1753," Because space has less gravity than the earth, which makes astronauts weightless. "
STDT 9287," The weight in space decreases because there is no gravity in space, and locations where there's no gravity the weight decreases.     "
STDT 9297, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because there is less gravity on the moon then Earth 
STDT 9300," Earth's planet has more gravity than the moon. Hence, making the weight on the moon lighter.  "
STDT 9301, Earth has a lot of gravity and on the moon it has some gravity.  
STDT 9305," The weight is much lighter because gravity is less in some locations. So an astronaut weighs less on the moon than the earth, but his or her mass remains the same. "
STDT 9311, Astronauts have different weight because the moon is further away from the sun so it has less gravitational force. 
STDT 9312, because it measured in force    
STDT 9313, because moon has less mass 
STDT 9314,"  Our weight  on  moon  is less than it would be on  Earth  due to a  difference  of the strength of gravity  on the moon . The  moon 's gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of the  moon . Since the  moon  has significantly less mass than the  Earth , it will not pull objects toward itself at the strength that  Earth  will. "
STDT 9315, it would be different because there is now gravity on the moon. 
STDT 9318," The astronaut weighs less on the moon. He has the same mass on the moon but the moon has less mass than the earth. This leads to a weaker gravitational pull than on the earth, which means the astronaut weighs less on the moon than on earth. "
STDT 9320, Because there is less gravity on the moon than on the earth. 
STDT 9321, weight changes in different locations. weight of an object increases in certain locations with more gravity. it also decreases in a place with less. 
STDT 9326,"  An astronaut's weight is different on the Moon than it is on the Earth because Earth's gravitational pull is stronger than the Moon's gravitational pull. The reason for that is because weight is mass of an object pulled down by gravity. Therefore, an astronaut's weight is heavier on Earth than it is on the Moon. "
STDT 9332, The moon has different gravity. 
STDT 9333, The moons' gravity is less than Earth. 
STDT 9336, An astronauts weight is different on the moon. The Earth has more gravity therefor the astronaut weights more. The Moon has less gravity so the astronaut weights less when he is on the moon. This is true even though the mass of the astronaut hasnt changed. 
STDT 9341," Since weight depends on both mass and gravity it changes on the moon and on earth. Therefore, on the moon you will weigh less that you would weigh on earth. "
STDT 9347, the moon has less gravity 
STDT 9348, Weight depends on gravity. An astronaut's weight on the moon is different from his/her weight on earth because there is less gravity on the moon. 
STDT 9349," On the moon there is less gravitational force, so they are lighter and on the Earth there is more gravitational force, so they are heavier.  "
STDT 9355,"                    So, how is the weight of a person different on the moon then it is on earth? Well, on different planets there is different gravity based on its size so since the moon is so much smaller competed to earth that means that there will be different gravity based on the mass of the plant. "
STDT 9357," The Moon has no gravity, which would mean weight is decreased. On earth there is gravity, so it does affect the weight of a person, and in conclusion. increases your weight. "
STDT 9358," Astronauts weight different on the moon than the earth because, the moon has no gravity and no gravity makes you weight lighter. But there is gravity on earth so you way more than you do on the moon because there is gravity. "
STDT 9362," Because the weight on the moon is 29 ibs, which increases your jump height and the weight on earth ðŸŒŽ is 175 ibs which decreases your jump height on the â˜¾ .   "
STDT 9365," An astronauts weight on differently on the earth and on the moon because on the earth, you will weigh a lot more because of all the gravity so let's say the astronaut weighs 400 pound with his gear. but because the moon only has about an 1/8 of earths gravitational pull you would only weigh about 50 pounds you would also get taller.  "
STDT 9368," An astronauts weight on Earth would be different because on earth there is more gravity pulling on our mass, but on other planets they have less gravitational pull on mass. And weight is the force acting on the object due to gravity. "
STDT 9374, There is a lack of gravity on the moon compared to the Earth. So an astronaut would weigh less on the moon then Earth.  
STDT 9375," The gravitational pull is different on the moon because the mass of the moon is different than the earth. Therefore, the moon's gravitational pull would have less effect on the astronaut, making him weigh less. "
STDT 9378, THERE IS NO GRAVITY IN SPACE. 
STDT 9380," It is different because,the Earth has a greater gravitational force than the Moon because the Earth is bigger than the Moon. "
STDT 8209, Mass and gravity 
STDT 9472,"The Moon has less gravity than the Earth, so if you are standing on the Moon you have less gravity pulling you down that would make you weigh less!"
STDT 9479," Astronauts weigh differently on the moon and on earth because, on the moon, you will weigh less due to the weaker gravitational force. "
STDT 9480," When the astronaut is on Earth there is alot of gravity keeping he or she on the ground, but on the Moon there is not much gravity so the astronaut is not pulled to the ground as much. "
STDT 4938," Our weight on moon is less than it would be on Earth due to a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon.The moon's gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon.This means that if you went to the moon you would weigh less, even though your mass stays the same. "
STDT 9483, Because on the moon there is less gravity so your a lot more lighter. 
STDT 9486," Our weight on moon is less than it would be on Earth due to a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon. The moon's gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon. ... This means that if you went to the moon you would weigh less, even though your mass stays the same "
STDT 9488, because the moon has less mass then the earth. 
STDT 9490," I believe that an astronaut's weight is different on the Moon than it is on planet Earth because Earth has more gravity than the Moon, and the force of gravity affects your weight, so if there's less gravity on the Moon, the astronaut would have less weight on the moon. "
STDT 9492," Well, the gravity depends on the weight of the specific item, same with mass. It also depends on the location that item is in. Like for example: A lamp weights 2 lbs, and its mass is 1. In the weight of the lamp would be 0 lbs and the mass would be the same. "
STDT 9501, A astronaut's weight would decrease due to the amount of mass on the moon . It has less mass than earth has .  
STDT 9503, Because of gravity. 
STDT 9505," The weight of the astronauts changed because when there is more gravity, like Earth, weight increases, but on the moon there is less gravity, so the weight of the astronauts decreases. "
STDT 9515, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the Earth. A reason for this the moon has no gravity and Earth does have gravity. The weight of something is because of its gravity. 
STDT 9517, ON the moon you float and on earth you will just fall. 
STDT 9522," An astronaut's weight is heavier on Earth than on the moon because on earth we have gravity that makes us stay on the ground and not float. The moon doesn't have gravity, so we can jump high, and we don't have as much weight as we do on Earth. "
STDT 9525, An astronaut's weight is less on the moon than it is on Earth because the gravitational force on the moon is weaker than it is on Earth. This is because the moon has less mass than Earth and will have a weaker gravitational pull.   
STDT 9530, An astronaut's weight is different on earth compared to the moon because the earth has a stronger gritational pull towards an object and the moon has a less stronger pull the still has gravity but very little  
STDT 9539, An astronaut's weight will be different on the moon because the moon has less mass than earth. 
STDT 9542, The gravity is different and the gravitational pull so there weight is more light on the moon because the gravity   
STDT 9546," Because the gravitational pull is much less. Meanwhile, his mass would stay the same because he still takes up the same amount of space that he did on earth. "
STDT 9547, It's different because the gravity is not the same on the moon as it is on the earth so the gravitational pull is different. 
STDT 9548, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the moon does not have that much gravitational pull compared to the earths gravitational pull. 
STDT 9551, It is different because the moon has gravity and gravity effects weight and earth lets weight be the same. 
STDT 9554," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because the weight changes depending on the location, so it will increase in a place with more gravity and it will decrease in a place with less gravity. So the moon has less gravity than earth, so the astronauts will weigh less than what they weigh on earth.  "
STDT 9559," Because if there's more gravity on the moon, the astronaut will be lighter, but on earth the gravity increases . "
STDT 9562, Why an astronauts weight is different on the moon is because much smaller than earth. because knowing that the bigger mass = a stronger gravitational pull and since the moon has less mas the less force and that's why your able to jump very high on moon and even can float 
STDT 9565, because the Earth has more gravity then the moon 
STDT 9566," Because the moon has less mass than the Earth, an astronaut's weight will be less on the moon than on the earth. "
STDT 9567," Well one earth we have gravity, so gravity makes us not flout and when we through a ball it does not flout it falls but in space does not have gravity, so your weight is much different on earth because as an example if you weight 68 pounds "
STDT 6112," The way it affects my weight is that it would go down. I am lighter on the moon than earth. Also, it is gravitational force. "
STDT 9571, An astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because Mass stays the same anywhere but weight is different because when you're in somewhere like space there is none to few gravitional pulls. 
STDT 9574, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than earth because there is less gravity on the moon than earth. 
STDT 9576, An astronauts weight on the moon is different because the moons gravitational force is a lot weaker than on earth thereby making you lighter. 
STDT 9577, Because the moon's gravity is weaker than the earth's gravity 
STDT 9587, Because the moon's mass is smaller than earth's mass so the is not as much gravity on the moon. Which causes his weight to not be as high as it was on earth. 
STDT 9588, Cause there is barely gravity on the moon so if in space there is less gravity than on earth than there would be less gravity on the moon. 
STDT 9596," If an astronaut weighs 120 LB on earth, then he goes to the moon, he will weigh only about 30-60 pounds. This is because of two things: There is nothing affecting his weight due to distance, other than his suit. And two, there is not as much of a gravitational pull on the moon than there is on earth.   "
STDT 9600, Cause the mass of earth is a bigger mass then the mass on the moon. 
STDT 705," weight is a measure of force it has to have mass and gravity. since weight depends on mass and gravity, it changes depending on location, so that why weight can be on the moon than earth.  "
STDT 9606, When the astronaut landed on the moon his weight changes because there is less gravity on the moon than on Earth. 
STDT 9607, the moon is still in orbit which means it has gravity. 
STDT 2017,     The weight would decrease or be different because on the moon there is a lack of gravity   
STDT 9608, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth is because we have more gravity on earth but on the moon we have less gravity. 
STDT 9612," Because the gravitational pull is less than on earth, so he would weigh less than how he normally would on earth. "
STDT 9613,"  Since weight is the force of gravity on an object, the weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. For example, the moon's gravity is less than Earth's. So an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on Earth, but his or her mass remains the same. "
STDT 9620," Because the moon is smaller than the Earth, the moon has a smaller gravitational force, so an astronaut would wheigh less on the moon.  "
STDT 9624," Because the gravity and forces , are different on earth than the moon . "
STDT 9627, The weight of an object changes depending on the object's location since weight is the force of gravity so if there is less gravity on the moon compared to the earth the astronaut would way less because the gravity on the moon is less.  
STDT 4485," The astronaut's weight on the moon is less than it would be on Earth due to the difference of the strength of gravity on the moon.  So, if you went to the moon would weigh less but your mass would stay the same. "
STDT 9629, There weight is different because they are far away from earth's gravity 
STDT 9630," It decreases on the moon because it has less gravity then earth, in other words gravity decreases in places with less gravity, but increases in places with more gravity. "
STDT 9634," The astronaut's weight on the moon is less that it is on Earth because there is less gravity on the moon. Mass is size that doesn't change. Weight is a measurement that is affected by the force of gravity. When there is more gravity there is more weight. On the moon, the astronauts are farther from the force of the Earth. "
STDT 9638," The mass of the moon is less than earth, so the force is less. This makes the astronaut weight less, "
STDT 9641,  Because earth has gravity it keeps on the ground so you way more. But because in space there is no gravity and on the moon. You way less than you would on earth. 
STDT 9642, Um it will be different cause there not on earth there on the moon so i think they be lighter. 
STDT 9643, the wight of then moon is smaller due to mass and it being out in space more 
STDT 9644, The moon is smaller than the earth so the gravitational force is less than the earth so your weight will change but your mass will stay the same. 
STDT 9647, becuase theres less gravity in space 
STDT 9650, An astronaut's weight is different than on earth because on the moon all the weight of the man or women decreases  
STDT 9653, that it whould be lighter on the moon than it wood be on earth so you can float kinda  
STDT 9655," Astronauts weigh differently because the moon has less gravity to push on you. So, your weight will be different than on earth. "
STDT 9656," When astronauts step on the moon, their weight will be different on the moon than on earth. That is because weight depends on gravity. Weight describes the force that pulls you down. "
STDT 9664, there is these gravity on the moon then on earth so there is less Gravitational pull  so he weighs less  
STDT 9666, It is different on the moon because the moon has no gravity but earth has a lot more than the moon. 
STDT 9667," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth because the moon has no gravitational pull, while the earth does have gravitational pull. "
STDT 9670," Weight depends on mass and gravity SO, when an astronaut is on the moon where there is zero gravity, the moon walking, space traveler's weight differs from earth because like i said in the begining ""weight depends on mass AND GRAVITY !!! and there is zero gravity in space.  (I kinda want to quote a movie that would kinda relate to this but i'm not going to because....well...yeah. But if you want to know what the quote is i recomend you to watch disney pixars movie ""LUCA"". ) "
STDT 9673, it is different because the gravity on the moon is less than it is on earth. You weight more on earth because of the amount of gravity  
STDT 9674," The Earth is larger than our Moon, so it is creating more force on our center of mass while the moon is much smaller than Earth making it seem we're nearly weightless on the Moon. "
STDT 9675, Because the mass on the moon has less mass than the earth. 
STDT 9683, because the moon has more mass than the earth  
STDT 9684, The gravity puls the astronaut less on the moon than on earth. 
STDT 9685, The moon has less gravity than the earth does. So an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on earth because there is much less gravitational force. His or her mass will not decrease or increase but stay the same as on earth. 
STDT 9686, Because there is less gravity because earth is farther away.   
STDT 9689," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because it has less mass than the Earth and the strength in gravity differs. For example, on the surface of the Moon an astronaut would appear lighter than they would on the Earth. This is because the weight and mass of the Moon is smaller than that of the Earth. "
STDT 9690, gravte pols it dawn 
STDT 9692, Our weight on the earth is much greater than on the moon because of the varying strength of the gravitational force. This is determined by the mass and size of the moon.  
STDT 9695, The weight difference on astronauts on the earth and moon is caused by gravity and mass differences  
STDT 9700, The astronauts would have less weight on the moon because the gravitational force is lighter. 
STDT 9702, Earth has more of a gravitational pull than the moon does.  
STDT 9703, The weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity and decrease in place with less. Astronauts weight less in the moon because there is less gravity than on earth. 
STDT 9704," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because of the gravity on the moon. The moon's mass is less than earth's, so that means that The gravitational force is also less than that of the earth's. This would conclude that an astronaut would weigh less on the moon.  "
STDT 9707, The astronauts weight is different on the moon because the moon is smaller than earth there for the gravity is weaker. 
STDT 9708," The Earth has more gravity than the moon. Earth circles the sun and has the gravitational pull of the sun and the moon has the gravitational pull of the Earth. -Answer by Gabby, Typed by mom"
STDT 9709, It depends on your location and the surface.  
STDT 9710," The weight of an object increases in a place with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. The moon's gravity is less than Earth's. So an astronaut weighs less on The Moon than on Earth, but their mass is still the exact same on both Earth and the Moon. "
STDT 9711, Because there is no gravity on the moon. 
STDT 9712, On the moon you weigh less because the gravity less.   
STDT 9715," On earth, the gravitational pull is increased.On the moon, the gravitational pull is decreased. "
STDT 9717, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the moon has less gravity than the Earth so the astronaut would weight less on the moon but his mass would stay the same. 
STDT 9718, On the moon there is less gravity.So you feel lighter. 
STDT 9721, There is no gravity in space. So their bodies move freely and there is gravity on earth. 
STDT 9728," Because weight is the force of gravity on a astronaut, the weight of a astronaut increases in a location which has more gravity and decreases in a location with less gravity. The moon has less gravity than Earth. So the summary is that a astronaut weighs less on the moon but still has the same amount of mass. "
STDT 9730, On the moon an astronaut's weight would be different than on earth because there is less gravity on the moon.  
STDT 9731," So in my own words, its because the moon doesn't have as much gravity or mass. It's a small size smaller than the earth anyway which kind of makes up for that but its still not small enough to make gravity identical when you step on it.  "
STDT 9733, An astronaunts weight is diffrent on the moon than it is on earth because in space there is no gravity but on earth there is so your weight is diffrent you will weigh more on earth then you do in space because of gravity. 
STDT 9742," When an astronaut is in a location with more gravity, his weight will increase. When the astronaut is in a place with less gravity his weight will also decrease.  "
STDT 9747, The astronaut's weight on the moon is different from on Earth because the amount of gravity on Earth pulling it down is greater than the gravity pulling down on the moon. 
STDT 9748," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on the earth is because on earth we weigh more because there is more gravity, and on the moon there is less gravity.  "
STDT 9751, It is different because of gravity. 
STDT 9755, Yes because there is less gravity so your weight is change when your in space 
STDT 9757," The moon has less gravitational force than the earth, meaning things weigh less on the moon than the earth  "
STDT 9759, There is less gravitational pull on the moon than there is on the earth. 
STDT 9765," Since weight is the force of gravity on an object, an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the weight of an object increases in a location with more gravity.  "
STDT 9769, Because the gravity is not on the moon it is on earth that is what is holding us down on the ground. 
STDT 1557, The moon does not have as much mass as earth. 
STDT 9782," It is different because on the moon there is 0 gravity, but on Earth the gravity is stronger. Therefore, on the moon I would weigh less, though on Earth I would stay the same. Also, I am pretty sure that weight depends on gravity, which is why I think this. "
STDT 9783, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the Earth because there is less gravity on the moon. 
STDT 9784," Astronauts' weight changes on the moon because the mass on the moon is less, so it is not able to pull down that much mass so they can float around with less weight. "
STDT 9786, Because the gravity on the moon is poor which makes weight seems like nothing. 
STDT 9791, A astronauts weight is different because there is no gravity on the moon. 
STDT 9792," The gravity on earth is stronger  the gravity on the moon is weaker, so you weigh less. "
STDT 9793, Cause on the moon there is less mass on there. 
STDT 9794," Because the gravitational force is different. The mass of the moon is less than the mass of the earth, so the gravitational force will affect you more on earth than on the moon. "
STDT 9799," because the moon has less gravity than the earth, so you will float on the moon, but not on earth. "
STDT 9803, The reason you may notice that your weight is different on the moon than on the earth is because the gravitational pull on the moon is less because the moon is smaller than the earth. 
STDT 4653," On earth we have gravity . Therefore we have our own weight. So on the moon with zero gravity, you would not have gravity as a resistance pushing you down. In space you float everywhere.  "
STDT 9824, because on the moon there's no gravity. 
STDT 9831," Weight contains gravity and mass. There is no gravity in space which affects your mass because you can not stand on a stable area to determine your weight, therefore it changes. "
STDT 9832," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the only thing that changes is your weight, not your mass. your weight will change because weight is the force of gravity on a object  so the weight of an object will increases in a place where there is more gravity "
STDT 9836," The reason why an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on earth is because weight needs both mass and gravity to stay the same. Since on the moon there is no gravity, your weight can not stay the same, so it changes. "
STDT 9838," The earth's moon has less mass than the earth itself. Also, the gravitational attraction is much less than it  is on earth.   "
STDT 9839,"  I think that an astronaut's weight on the moon is affected by the amount of gravity on the moon. The amount of gravity on the moon is very low, which makes the astronaut's weight decrease. "
STDT 9844, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on the earth because of the weak force of gravitation.  
STDT 9847, There is more of a gravitation pull 
STDT 9852, Because the moons gravitational pull is weaker than earths. 
STDT 9853, because on earth there is more mass than on the moon. 
STDT 9854, The moon has less gravity than earth which makes the astronaut weigh less than they would on earth. 
STDT 9855, Since the moon has weaker  gravitational pull  and the moon only have a little bit of gravity that the earth has that means you will weigh six  times less on the moon than you actually do on earth. 
STDT 9856," The weight of the astronaut on the moon will get lighter, because there is less gravity (weight) on the person.  The mass still stays the same, but the weight changes because there is less gravity pushing down on the person.  "
STDT 9858," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because the gravitational force of the moon is less than Earth's, and it makes you weigh less there. "
STDT 9860, An astronaut's weight would be different on the moon because the moon has less gravity than the earth. 
STDT 9863, gravitational pull i think. 
STDT 9867, The Earths moon has less mass. 
STDT 9869," It would be different because the gravitation on the moon is deferent, so on the moon your weight is different, and you flat on the air most on the time, and on earth you have a gravitation, buts it's not as super graviton, because if it was a super gravitation then you would be on the floor, so the gravitation on the earth is a normal. "
STDT 9876," It's because there is less gravity on the moon, than on the earth. "
STDT 9877, Earth has a stronger gravitational pull than the moon does. That is because Earth has a greater mass. 
STDT 9879," The weight is different because on the moon there is less gravity than on the earth, so the astronaut's weight is less and his mass is the same. "
STDT 9880, Because the moon has less gravity than the Earth so the weight is different when there's less gravity your weight goes down but the mass stays the same so that is why astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on the Earth. 
STDT 5777, The pressure is dense. Gravity in space is different from earth because in space astronauts experience no gravity but on earth they dp 
STDT 9884, Astronauts'weights are different on the moon than they are on earth because the earth's gravity level is higher than it is on the moon. 
STDT 9889," Weight is the force of gravity on an object, because the moon has less gravity, you weigh less. "
STDT 9893," There's less gravitational force on the moon than there is on earth, so the astronauts (even thou they weight the same) they feel lighter and can jump way higher.   "
STDT 9894, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than on Earth because the moon has a larger mass than the Earth. The astronaut's weight would be weightless even though his mass would stay the same. 
STDT 9896, The astronauts weight is diferent because on earth is pulling you down and in the moon you do not have weight because of the gravity. 
STDT 9897," They're weight changed because there is less gravity on the moon, but that had no effect on their mass. "
STDT 9903," An Astronaut's mass is different on the moon because of the gravitational force. That is because, since the astronaut is in space, there is no gravity. The moon has less gravity than the earth.  "
STDT 9904," An astronaut's weight is different because the mass of the moon is less than the mass of the Earth. Therefore, there is less gravity pulling on the astronaut.  "
STDT 9907," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the Earth because weight depends on mass and gravity. For example, if a human was stationed on a planet with less mass than Earth the human's weight would change depending on the planet's exact mass. "
STDT 9920, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon then it is on the Earth because of the different amount of gravity on the Earth and moon. 
STDT 9921," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the earth because the weight of an object is increased in a location with more gravity and decreases in a place with less. For example, the moon's gravity is less than Earth's. "
STDT 9923, The astronauts' weight will be less on the Moon than on the Earth because the Moon is smaller and has less gravity. 
STDT 9924, Weight changes in different locations such as the moon compared to the earth. The moon has a less gravity which would make the astronaut weigh less. 
STDT 9925, Weight on Earth  is different from on the moon because the Gravitational pull is different although the mass is the same  
STDT 9926," Yes, the astronaut's weight changed, but not his mass on the moon. The weight changed because there is less gravitation pull on the moon, so the weight changes. The mass does not change because it is the amount of matter in an object and matter does not change only weight. "
STDT 983," A:  Our weight  on  moon  is less  than  it would be on  Earth  due to a difference  of  the strength  of  gravity on the  moon . The  moon's  gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size  of  the  moon . ... This means that if you went to the  moon  you would  weigh  less, even though  your  mass stays the same "
STDT 9931, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the earth because on Earth the mass is greater than it is on the moon.That's why the weight of an astronaut is different on the moon.  
STDT 9933," The moon is smaller than our home planet and if something is smaller, the force will follow and will decrease, so that means the gravitational force will also decrease, so that means the moon has a weaker gravitational force than the earth. "
STDT 9934," The gravitational pull on the moon is not as strong as it is here on earth, so you would weigh less. "
STDT 9937, The mass of the moon is smaller than the Earth so there is less gravitational pull on the moon. 
STDT 9942," On earth, mass is measured in kg and your weight is measured in pounds, but due to gravity, weight depends on both mass and gravity.  "
STDT 9945," On earth, astronauts would weigh up to 100 pounds, but when on the moon, astronauts would weigh almost nothing because of the change in gravity. gravity affects anythings weight  "
STDT 9946, Weight needs mass and gravity so it changes depending on where you are. Since the astronaut is on or around the moon and the moon has less gravity the astronaut's weight would be less. 
STDT 9947,"   On the moon there is less gravitational force because the moon is smaller and has less mass so the astronaut weighs less. On the big round earth there is more mass it means there is more gravity, and so he would weigh more! "
STDT 9949," because the earth has less mass than the moon, the weight is smaller than on earth. That means that also the gravitational pull is less than on earth. "
STDT 9952," ""‹The moon and the earth are closer than the earth and the sun are while the sun has greater mass than the earth, therefor they have different gravitational forces "
STDT 3762," The gravity on earth is different than the gravity on the moon. Since gravity is based on weight and mass being the amount of matter, the weight also deepened on those traits too, so it changes the weight based on gravity and mass on the moon. "
STDT 9957," Because, the moon has less mass than earth so it is very diffrent "
STDT 9960," because on the moon, gravity is very low compared to the earth, because the earth's gravity makes you go down when you jump faster than the moon. "
STDT 9963," The moon has a weaker gravitational force than Earth, due to its smaller mass. An astronaut would weigh less because of this, even though their mass would stay the same. "
STDT 9964," The moon doesn't have gravity, The mass and weight isn't the same as earths.  "
STDT 9967, The gravitational pull is not as strong on the moon as the earth . Because the earth is bigger and has more gravitational pull.  
STDT 9970," Since weight is the force of gravity on an object,the weight increases in a location with more gravity and increases in a place with less. "
STDT 9971, An astronauts weight is different on the moon because the moon is smaller than Earth which means the moon will have less gravitational pull than on Earth so this will make the astronauts weigh less. 
STDT 9972, Because the moon has the less gravity. the earth is bigger so it has more. 
STDT 2299," as further you go from earth there is less gravitational force, so the weight get lighter going further from earth "
STDT 9978, Because in the planet there are less mass then on earth 
STDT 9984, Astronauts' weight is different because of the force thats  pulling them down it creates more force and makes you heavier or lighter depending on how much force is pulling you down. 
STDT 9367, Our weight on the moon is less because the difference of strength on the moon. 
STDT 9985, There is less gravity than on the moon than the earth  
STDT 2692," The strength of the gravitational field is weaker, meaning everything on the moon weighs less than what it really weighs on Earth. "
STDT 9986,"  The moon's gravity is less than on Earth, so an astronaut weighs less on the moon, but his or her mass stay's the same.  So the astronaut is way lighter on the moon than on earth.   "
STDT 9987,  An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because on the moon the astronauts weight is lighter than on earth.  
STDT 10085, An astronauts weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because there is no gravitational force on the moon. 
STDT 10086, The weight of an object decreases due to when there is less of a gravitational force on the object such as the moon. 
STDT 10089, because the moon has less gravity 
STDT 10090, uh because the moon is smaller than the earth which makes you bigger than on earth so it would cause the mass to change? 
STDT 10092,  An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because there's less mass on the moon making the astronaut weight less.   
STDT 10096," Because weight is a measure of force it has to have both mass and gravity. On the moon it has less gravity and when you're on Earth it has more, so you have less force pushing you down on the moon. "
STDT 10097, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on earth because there is less gravity on the moon. 
STDT 1384, His weight leaves his body only  and he will only be 29 pounds   
STDT 7926, Because weight depends upon gravity and mass but gravity on earth differs from gravity on the moon.  
STDT 10101, There is no gravity in space and there is on the earth. 
STDT 10102, because the moons mass is not as large as earth and the more mass the more gravity 
STDT 10103," There is less gravity on the moon. Weight is determined by the amount of gravitational force. Therefore, an astronaut weighs less on the moon than on the Earth.   "
STDT 10104, Astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because on the moon the surface gravity is different from what it is on Earth. 
STDT 10112, Anyone on the moon is going to weigh less than people on earth so weight loss not gain would happen if you were an astronaut on the moon. 
STDT 10113, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the Moon has less of a gravitational force on the astronauts body since the Moons mass is smaller than the Earths mass. 
STDT 10114, Because the moon doesn't have gravity. 
STDT 10120," The moon has less gravitational attraction then it does here on earth, causing a person to weigh less then they would on earth. "
STDT 10121, because the moon has less mass then the earth so there for we are going to weigh less 
STDT 10123, Our weight on the moon is different on earth because of the strength of the gravitational force on the moon. 
STDT 10130, The lager mass would increase gravity which would increase wight. 
STDT 10303, The pull of gravity is stronger on the Earth than it is on the moon so you will weigh more on Earth than you do on the moon.   Ms. Judson :)
STDT 10305," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the earth because the moon has more gravity than the earth does. So, on the moon, the astronaut would weigh much less than on the earth.   "
STDT 10308, A planet with more mass will have a greater pull of gravity and will make you weigh more. 
STDT 10313, An astronaut's weight is different on the moon then it is on earth because there is no gravity in space and on earth there is.  
STDT 10317, The weight of an astronaut is different on the moon because the gravitational force on the moon is less then earth. 
STDT 10319, Our weight on moon is less than it would be on earth due to the difference of the strength  of gravity on the moon.
STDT 10324, It is because of the gravitational force.  On Earth we have more gravitational force on us and on the moon the gravitational force is less.
STDT 10325,"The astronauts weigh less in space than earth because in space there is no gravitational force, so the astronaut weigh less."
STDT 10328, The astronauts weight is different on the moon because there is less gravity on the moon then on the Earth and when there is less gravity the weight decreases. 
STDT 10330, The astronaut's weight is different on the moon because the gravitational force of the moon is less than that of Earth.
STDT 10332," An astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth because weight is the force of gravity on an object. A location with more gravity means your weight will increase. A location with less gravity means your weight will decrease. And since the moon's gravity is less than the gravity on earth, the astronaut's mass is the same but their weight is lighter on the moon. "
STDT 10343,The gravitational pull is less on the moon compared to the Earths. Since mass and gravitational pull determine weight the astronaut will weigh less on the moon.          
STDT 10349," It is because of gravity. For example: on Earth, the astronaut is 100 pounds; on the moon, they would be about 17 pounds. Because of the pull of gravity on the Earth, and the reduced amount of gravity on the moon, the astronaut weighs more on Earth. "
STDT 10351, cause the weight of a person is different in space
STDT 10353, The weight of the astronaut is different on the moon than on the earth because the gravitational pull is different so the astronaut's weight would be less. 
STDT 10367," Astronauts' weights are different in space because there is no gravity, so gravity doesn't pull their weight down as it does on earth.  "
STDT 10390, On the moon there is no gravity. 
STDT 10407, because they like jump and then like fly bc of gravity and on earth u cant do that. 
STDT 10439, gravity is diffrent 
STDT 10505, it would be gravity and mass.
STDT 10588, It is different because in space theres no gravity so u float 
STDT 7320,because he\she is floating and very little gravity on the moon and there mass will be reduced on there body   
STDT 10691, My weight will increase because there no gravity in space. 
STDT 10705, on earth your measured in kg and there weight is measured in pounds. weight is affected by mass and gravity and there is no gravity in space so your weight is affected. 
STDT 10753, It's different because on the there is no gravity 
STDT 10788, An astronaut 
STDT 10868, because weight is a measure of force it requires an object to have both mass and gravity
STDT 10891,  On the moon there bodies have to adapt to no gravitational force. 
STDT 10892, because there is no gravity 
STDT 11045, hg       
STDT 11134," The only reason is because there is not that much gravitational force on the moon as there is on the earth. Let's say you weigh 30 pounds on the earth in space, your like 5 pounds, including gear, so you can breathe in space. "
STDT 11137, There is no gravity on the moon. 
STDT 11142, The earth's moon has less mass and that means astronauts weigh less on the moon and people that go on earth have greater mass and it also means it depends on weight. 
STDT 291, Your weight is different in space because it is measured by mass  
STDT 11170, Your weight is different on earth because you are weighed in kilograms. On the moon you are weighed in newtons. 
STDT 10357, our body weight is less on the moon beacause gravity is stronger on the moon  
STDT 6241, An astronaut 
STDT 11237, you fat 
STDT 11273," The Moon doesn't have any gravity, Earth does. "
STDT 11277, because it wights different on the moon 
STDT 11281, Because you are on no gravity so you float 
STDT 7300, Why an astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on Earth? It is because of gravity of a location and how it changes  due to different locations with less gravity. 
STDT 11313, the moon has a small atmosphere and there is no gravity in space so the gravity in space goes to the moons surface 
STDT 11319," Because on the moon, an astronaut can jump higher and go farther than being on earth. "
STDT 11320," The moon does not have gravity. There is no weight because, there is no gravitational force.b "
STDT 11328, There is little to no gravitational force on the moon compared to Earth. 
STDT 11354, BECAUSE THERE IS NO GRAVITY ON THE MOON SO THERE IS NO GRAVITATIONAL PULL. 
STDT 11521," I think the astronaut's weight is different on the moon than it is on the earth because in the moon there is no gravity, but on the earth there is and that pulls the person down"
STDT 11557," On earth theres gravity, on the moon there is no gravity. "
STDT 11560, gravity is pulling him down on earth as of on the moon in spaced there is no gravity.
